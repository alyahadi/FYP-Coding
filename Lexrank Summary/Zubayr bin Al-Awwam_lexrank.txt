--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
And this uncle was Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, and I believe it was a few years ago that I  gave a khutbah about him because he was a fascinating character to me. You don't hear the Prophet  talk much about him but he was  fierce in his persecution of the Prophet  and the things that he would  to the Prophet  and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet  that the Prophet  nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh. And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet  who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet . He's the first cousin of the Prophet  because of his mother, Safiyyah, and of course his father was the brother of Khadijah . he's inseparable from Talha, even in their names, Talha and Az-Zubayr and Ali  as well in the age and in the closeness that they have. His cousin, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, the brother of Zainab ibn Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with them was also killed and that's very hurtful to Az-Zubayr  as well, because of how much he loves him and Az-Zubayr  was wounded heavily that day and he's one of the few people that did not flee from the Prophet  on the day of Uhud. When the Prophet   to Zubayr, I would sacrifice my mother and my father for you.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
They  that he embraced Islam  away with Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  and he is inseparable from Talha ibn Ubaidullah , who we'll talk about after Asma . And the youth, they're only 12 or 13 years old each as they're coming to embrace Islam, and they listen to the da'wah of Abu Bakr, and immediately they're convinced. When Zubayr embraced Islam, he lost all of his friends with the exception of Talha and Ali, as well, who were close to his age and also his first cousin because of Abu Talib. And sitting together as brothers, , they loved each other, they grew up together, they embraced Islam together, they were the same age, they had a history.

--- Persecution Summary ---
You don't hear the Prophet  talk much about him but he was  fierce in his persecution of the Prophet  and the things that he would  to the Prophet  and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet  that the Prophet  nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh. Zubayr  was going to be tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid which was known at the time especially with the early converts before the open persecution of people that people would be tortured by their own families. After Islam, now his uncle comes and beats him and this is a man that was called the Shaytan of Quraish for a reason. He would wrap Zubayr  up in a rug and he put him in a small room and then he would light a fire next to his face and the smoke of that fire would suffocate Zubayr  and he would step on him and beat him and tell him to renounce Islam. But it wasn't the screaming of torture, it was the screaming of resistance. He would always be amongst the people of Dar al-Arqam, listening to the Quran as it came down, accompanying the Prophet , despite whatever torture he would have to face. But the Prophet  was sitting one day and as he is sitting, Zubayr , this young man who is facing the torture of his life comes running towards the Prophet  breathing heavily and he's holding his sword.

--- Hijra Summary ---
he came back to Mecca prior to the migration to Medina and he marries Asma’, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr  wanted his daughters to be married to those who were struggling in the path of Allah . Asma’  made the hijrah while she was very late in her pregnancy, and obviously Asma’ played a role in the hijrah of the Prophet , which we'll talk about. She was not just tasked with traveling from Mecca to Medina, but she also plays a role in assisting the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  in the migration of the Prophet , all while she was very pregnant. Asma’ and Zubayr arrive in Medina, and obviously when you read about the hijrah to Medina and you read about the way that the Muslims who came from Mecca felt, they felt  Medina was death. One of them of course being the change of environment, the difficulties of the hijrah, and just the rate of fatalities at birth at the time, but Asma’  and Az-Zubayr would be the first to have a child that gave birth to none other than Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr .

--- Battle Summary ---
And we know about his legacy in the battlefield  that should give you an image of Az-Zubayr , that he could ride in the battlefield with both of his swords, and he was extremely productive in battle, guiding his horse with only his legs. two amongst 315 Muslims had horses, one of them was Az-Zubayr . He would run between the horsemen and he would wield both of his swords and he would knock people off of their swords  and left in the battle of Badr, and he would suffer two serious wounds in the battle of Badr, which we'll talk about and that didn't slow him down at all. On the other side, there was a man by the name of Talha ibn Abi Talha al-Adri, and he was a huge man from Quraysh, and he also had the best horse of the Mushrikeen,  he is coming forward and he is challenging the Muslims, and he is the best horseman. He is someone who is boastful and arrogant, that has a reputation,  he comes out on the best horse and he calls out and says, “Who is going to come forth and duel with me?” The only person that answers the call is Az-Zubayr  and the Prophet  lets Az-Zubayr go. They come forth and they meet Ali ibn Abi Talib  before the battle of Al-Jamal, and this is a very tragic conversation and way that he's going to die, but in brief, we know that Aisha  and Ali  would talk, they would come to terms, they would go back to their camps and the idea was that there was going to be no battle, that they came to an agreement, that Ali was going to pursue the killers of Uthman, and that things were going to move forward. Ali  is sitting in his tent and the sword of Zubayr  comes in front of him and Ali  starts to cry and he starts to weep loudly and Ali  , I heard the prophet  , “When you meet the murderer of Ibn Safiyya, when you see the person who kills Zubayr, tell him he's a person of hellfire.”  Ali had heard this hadith from the prophet , he give the news to the one who murders Ibn Safiyya, Zubayr , that he's a person of hellfire.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
The type of strength that she was imparting upon Zubayr  and hoping that he would grow up with, and of course he would grow up with that strength and exceed all of the expectations of that strength and that courage and that intelligence and that nobility and that honour. And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet  who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet . He's the first cousin of the Prophet  because of his mother, Safiyyah, and of course his father was the brother of Khadijah . That's what I was going to do.”  the Prophet  was impressed by the courage of Zubayr that he wasn't thinking about his own persecution. that's why Zubayr  earns that noble title of being the first one to draw his sword in defence of the Prophet  in Mecca as the persecution would start to grow of our messenger . You don't get any more courageous than this, alright  this man, who no one wanted a piece of, who has the best horse on the other side,  the best case scenario is that you get the horse too you get the armor, too but  you just want to take him out. You give me one Az-Zubayr  is  having a thousand men due to his bravery and the way that he moved forward.

--- Death Summary ---
His cousin, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, the brother of Zainab ibn Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with them was also killed and that's very hurtful to Az-Zubayr  as well, because of how much he loves him and Az-Zubayr  was wounded heavily that day and he's one of the few people that did not flee from the Prophet  on the day of Uhud. After Umar bin Khattab  passed away, Az-Zubayr of course being one of the remaining 10 promised paradise was chosen to be on the shura of Umar bin Khattab , and Az-Zubayr  of course the shura came together and they chose they cast their vote. And I have to mention his death because one of the most tragic deaths that we have and in fact that is the case not just with him, but with his son. How is it that a person  incredible,  amazing, would be killed in the fitan from the inside, not taken out from an enemy on the outside, but on the fitan from the inside. And by the way this is something about the death of Zubayr in his salah. One of them is from Abdullah ibn Zubayr , he  that Az-Zubayr came to me on the day of his death before he would die, and he just saw the scene and he could smell death in the air, he knew something was going to happen. I think I'm going to die today as an oppressed one.” I don't know why but sensing death and this is something with the salihin that sometimes you see that they sense death,  he's telling his son, Abdullah, that listen I'm sensing death.
