--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
But I want us to think about the story of Bilal before Islam, because there's something about the message of the Prophet  that is resonating instantaneously with people that have been subjugated in the name of false gods. And in the famous narration with Abu Dharr saying those words, and of course some of the narrations suggesting that it was Bilal that he  those words to, it would make sense because it was a reminder that even though Bilal’s father was an Arab, his mother being an Abyssinian who was enslaved, is really what his status was reflective of. He's worth more to us than any price that he would have named. And Umayyah did not accept the name of Abdurrahman. And  that's a story that becomes within the family at that point of Bilal and Umayyah ibn Khalaf. And according to Ibn Jawzi and others, this is where the verse in Surah Al-Hujurat, that, “Oh people, we have made you into male and female, nations and tribes, that you may get to know one another and verily, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah  is the one with the most piety.” And , Bilal has the privilege of climbing on top of the Ka’bah and saying, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. And there is another narration from Abdullah Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and his father who , “Glad tidings of Bilal.” And he , “For what ya Aba Abdillah?” He , “I heard the messenger of Allah   that Bilal will come on the day of judgment holding a standard and all the mu'adhins will follow Bilal until they enter Jannah.” That's a narration that Suyuti considers authentic.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
He is well known for his struggle, especially as he initially embraced Islam. Imam Muslim has the virtues of Salman, Bilal, and Suhayb to obviously reflect Salman being the first Persian, Bilal being the first Abyssinian who was enslaved to accept Islam, and Suhayb being the first Roman to accept Islam. Now Bilal embraces Islam upon hearing of the da'wah of the Prophet  immediately. And  Bilal embraces Islam. And all of it comes from obviously the place of certainty and steadfastness that Bilal had when he accepted Islam. And Umayyah did not accept the name of Abdurrahman. Many of those who entered Islam knew, they made comments, even though they'd embraced Islam, they made comments.

--- Persecution Summary ---
Umayyah did not anticipate the resilience of Bilal in the face of this humiliation, in the face of this torture. And Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud  that when they were put in the iron chains and tortured most severely, the only one who would never show his pain was Bilal. Finally, Umayyah tries to torture Bilal in the most severe way, which is that he has Bilal tied to the hot surface in the desert. And Bilal hears obviously that last word of humiliation from the man that has tortured him for all of these years. He says to Bilal, why is it that when you were being tortured, and he refers to him as our master who was freed by our master. He says, “How come when you were being tortured, all you  was Ahadun Ahad, one, one?” , Bilal’s response was, “If I knew anything about Allah other than one, one, then I would have  it.” How simple the word, La ilaha illallah encapsulated in Ahadun Ahad, and Bilal does not know any other names of Allah, he doesn't call upon Allah with any du'a book, he doesn't have the names of Allah memorized. And his master Umayyah or his previous master, of course, who tortured him and oppressed him, Umayyah ibn Khalaf.

--- Battle Summary ---
And of course, as we mentioned in the story of Waraqa, that it does not add up from a timeline perspective that he  to Umayyah that, Wallahi, if you kill him, then I will build a shrine for him. And  Umayyah  tried to find many loopholes to get out of this, to get out of the battle of Badr, but had to go out as Abu Jahl had shamed him. in regard to Umayyah ibn Khalaf, this is no longer in the battle. He says, I literally had to protect Umayyah while Bilal and some of the Ansar were poking with their swords around me, trying to get past me to hit him. And it was the mercy of Allah  that Allah preserved those early slaves in Mecca to be there on Fath Makkah, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, and not die in the battles that would take place between the original call of Islam and that eventual conquest of Mecca, which represented the great victory of Islam. You're lucky that the swords of Allah did not reach your throat as they should have. And if you have freed me for yourself, then hold me and do with me what you want.” Abu Bakr , “Of course I freed you for Allah, O Bilal.” He says to him, “Go ahead.” And Bilal goes out to Ash-Sham in the process of Jihad, just  many of the companions went out in battle against the Romans at that moment.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
However, Tawheed was the first  that Bilal found that resonated with him, ahadun ahad. One that values him solely on that basis and that extols his virtue because of that and nothing else. And that is also important to the context of the adhan of Bilal being the first mu'adhin. And he's also the first treasurer of the Prophet , the one who would maintain the charity and the wealth as it came into the messenger of Allah . There are many ways to attribute the first to Bilal. The first man to call the Adhan in Medina and then in Mecca, will now be the first man to call the Adhan in Al-Quds, making him the first mu'adhin in all three of the holiest places in Islam. And I'll just end with these few narrations of the virtues of Bilal and there's  many.

--- Death Summary ---
And  you can imagine then what the death of the Prophet  will do to him, ? And  that gives some context and I'm jumping a bit because we haven't got to that point of what the death of the Prophet  will do to Bilal. And he told Abdurrahman that he'll ransom himself with the most expensive of property to get himself out of being killed or being in that fight. And Bilal killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf that day and took his revenge that day for what was done to him. And  Bilal stands up after the death of the Prophet  and he starts to call the Adhan. But Amwas, many of the books  mentioned that this is when Bilal passed away in Ash-Sham due to the plague of Amwas in the year 639, where 25,000 people died, including the likes of Mu'adh ibn Jabal and  many of the great companions of the Prophet . And the only reason we don't have more hadith from him is because of the age at which he died, and the distance that he kept away from the city of Medina after the death of the Prophet .
