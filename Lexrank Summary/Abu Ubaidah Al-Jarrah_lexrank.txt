--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
When we talk about Abu Ubaidah al-jarrah  this is a man that was  elevated and  high in the eyes of the companions of the prophet  and the prophet  himself but we don't often talk about him in the capacity of the rest of the ten promised paradise and I think that as people sort of go through the names of the ten promised paradise there are always a few names that are forgotten  often forgotten when people are trying to recount those ten names. He's from the tribe known as Banu al-Harith ibn Fihr, and it is a distant tribe from the Prophet . One of them is that it could be that his grandfather played more of a fatherly role in his life  when the Prophet  mentions that I am the son of Abdul Muttalib. He also has a brother by the name of Yazid, who did convert to Islam and is considered a sahabi, may Allah be pleased with him, but we don't have much information about him at all. When it came to Abu Ubaidah, one of the narrations that we find that is commonly mentioned is that his own father was after him in battle and that his own father wanted to sacrifice him. And when they were put in that situation where their own family members had come out against them to kill them, Allah  had removed any burden from them in that regard. But nonetheless, we find that Abu Ubaidah ,  the other companions of the Prophet  was put in a difficult situation in which he had to fight against his own family members.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
His mother her name was Umayma, but her lineage is disputed and according to Ibn Hajar, though we don't have any information on her, she is  considered one who accepted Islam. his father certainly is not amongst those that accepted Islam, his mother may have accepted Islam according to some narrations. Now, when did he accept Islam? He was a teenager, 18 or 19 years old, and he's considered one of the first ten people to accept Islam. Abu Ubaidah  is considered to be from that first group of people who accepted Islam at the hands of whom? He embraces Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, amongst the first group that were given da'wah by Abu Bakr, and he immediately accompanies the Prophet  and becomes one from the people of Dar al-Arqam. But you find some incidents where the Prophet  himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet , beyond the fact that he is one of the people of Badr, that he is one of the earliest that accepted Islam, that he is one of the people that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle.

--- Persecution Summary ---
Now, other than that, when it comes to his Meccan life, there isn't much that is talked about at all, in fact, except that he was tortured and that he was patient. And  you'll find that some of the writers will mention that he was tortured by his father  severely that he was almost killed. Some of them  that one of the reasons why there's such silence on him in Meccan seerah, which generally is not covered as much as the seerah in Medina, is because he went into hiding because of the severity of the persecution. When you're there, imagine the scenes of persecution and imagine the scene of victory because they're both very important when you're there. There are long years of persecution of the Messenger , where as you're sitting there around the Kaaba, you can look around and you can imagine some of those narrations about the Prophet  first being persecuted around the Kaaba and all of these wonderful companions that we have covered, may Allah be pleased with them all.

--- Hijra Summary ---
And even his hijrah to Abyssinia is there's no information except that he is amongst those that made the hijrah, the second migration to Abyssinia. And Al-Dhahabi says if he indeed made that migration, that it wasn't for long. He went to Abyssinia; he gained the reward of making hijrah to Abyssinia because there's a reward in hijrah, and he returned to Mecca for some time until he made hijrah to Medina as well. And his brother from the Ansar when he made hijrah was the great Mu'adh ibn Jabal . he gained one of the great distinctions amongst the companions was to be from amongst those that made the two migrations. And then Abu Ubaidah  appoints Mu'adh ibn Jabal , his brother in the hijrah, and he dies.

--- Battle Summary ---
he didn't just fight alongside the Prophet  in every battle. But you find some incidents where the Prophet  himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet , beyond the fact that he is one of the people of Badr, that he is one of the earliest that accepted Islam, that he is one of the people that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle. But because the Prophet  did not assign a leader between Abu Ubaidah and Amr, may Allah be pleased with them, as soon as they leave, when they're on the way, Amr says to Abu Ubaidah that, “Listen, I'm leading this army and you're following me.”  Amr insists upon his leadership position and Abu Ubaidah immediately gives it to him and he  even puts Amr forward to lead the salah, even though Amr was a new Muslim. it came to a point where we didn't even have that one tamr that we would look forward to that one date every day. Meaning they put more trust in the sword of Khalid than in Allah ,  he replaced Khalid ibn Walid  with Abu Ubaidah al-Jarrah and Abu Ubaidah received this in the middle of battle and he didn't tell Khalid  away because the battle was about to start and he did not want to disrupt the battle or Khalid's plan. We don't seek the leadership of this world and we don't work for this world, but instead, we are all brothers for the sake of Allah .”  Abu Ubaidah  waited until after the battle, and then it was known that Abu Ubaidah was the commander, the general, but at times, Khalid  is still appointed to lead specific missions and armies. Because they were both brilliant in battle, that Damascus was conquered at the same time by Abu Ubaidah and Khalid.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
Everyone and welcome back to the first. He was a teenager, 18 or 19 years old, and he's considered one of the first ten people to accept Islam. Again, you're going to keep on seeing people that are within the first 10, 15, or 20. But you find some incidents where the Prophet  himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet , beyond the fact that he is one of the people of Badr, that he is one of the earliest that accepted Islam, that he is one of the people that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle. Though it would be understood that Abu Ubaidah  because of his seniority, his being amongst the first, his being a people of Badr, his being someone who lost his teeth in service of the Messenger  and Uhud, being a memorizer of Quran, that he would be amongst those, or he would be considered the natural leader. Abu Bakr  would not  that except that he has thought about it and he has taken a thoughtful decision  knowing who these people are, knowing the virtue of Umar and knowing the virtue of Abu Ubaidah, and he says that choose either one of them. I gave a lecture, a break from The Firsts, about the plague of Amwas.

--- Death Summary ---
Abu Ubaidah , as a young man, in fact they  that by the time he was six, he could already handle a bow and arrow, and by the time he was twelve, he was already more skilled than the most skilled warrior. And  you'll find that some of the writers will mention that he was tortured by his father  severely that he was almost killed. that was his position with the Prophet , and when the Prophet  passed away, Abu Bakr al-sadiq , of course in the famous incident of going to the saqeefa, he takes with him Abu Ubaidah and Umar, may Allah be pleased with them. Abu Ubaidah had come to meet Umar outside of greater Syria, and as they were meeting outside of ash-sham on the border, the news came to them that the plague had struck and that people were dying  and left, and  the discussion then becomes should Umar  proceed to ash-sham or should he turn back. he  to Abu Ubaidah, “We're fleeing from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah.” And Abdurrahman ibn Auf  intervenes, and he , “I have heard from the Prophet  directly that the Prophet   that if you hear of a plague that breaks out in the land, do not enter it, but if the plague breaks out while you are in that land, then do not leave it.”  the famous hadith that has been cited  much over the past year about quarantining and things of that sort,  this is the context of that, this discussion between Umar and Abu Ubaidah. And the plague then started to ravage more people and Umar  was worried about some of his sahaba that were still there and at the top of that list was Abu Ubaidah . Abu Ubaidah  takes his camel, starts to look for a place, and then he also struck by the plague and the people rushed to their leader, to Abu Ubaidah , who is the head of them all, he's the leader of Ash-Sham.
