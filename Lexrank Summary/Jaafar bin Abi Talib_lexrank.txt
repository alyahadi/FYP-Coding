--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam. Al-Abbas, who is the brother of Abu Talib, the uncle of the Prophet , comes to the Prophet  and he says that Abu Talib is going through some difficult times, that he is suffering from poverty. And he , he left the home, and this is where we  find the famous narration where the Prophet  , “Make food for the family of Ja'far  because they are busy with the news that has come to them.”  this is where we find the sunnah of taking care of the family when they are dealing with death in the family. It's not just the way that they trace their lineage back to who it is from Banu Hashim they trace their lineage to, but they  have a unique thing for Ja'far  where they prepare the names on the leather and they trace the lineage back that for their portion of Banu Hashim, they have two wings at the top and growing up it's, I would always look at that on her wall  next to her bed, those two wings of Ja'far  and then the family of Ja'far  descending from that. As for Asma’ bint Umais, may Allah be pleased with her, when we talk about the way that the companions used to marry the widows, Asma’ bint Umais, you might have heard her name already a few times as we're going through the stories of these people Asma’ bint Umais  after the death of Ja'far was married to none other than Abu Bakr as-Siddiq . Abu Bakr marries Asma’ and he has his one son in Islam born to Asma’ bint Umais and he is Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Abu Bakr and Ja'far and Ali and Asma’ and the children that came from that and the lessons that we take from the treatment of widows, the way the Prophet  consoled that family, the way that the community move forward with that family.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam. Some of the reports  that he was as early as the 15th or 16th person to accept Islam. And if Ali  embraced Islam that early, and then Fatima bint Asad embraced Islam that early, Ja'far is amongst those who embraced Islam very early on with his cousin, the Prophet . And the dates suggest that it was probably just  we saw with Sa'eed bin Zayd and Fatima bint al-Khattab, Ja'far and his wife Asma’ bint Umais accepting Islam together. Or he could have accepted them but rejected their religion, all ? He does not accept their religion  away. At that point, Najashi dismisses everyone from the courts, and he tells Ja'far  that he himself has now embraced Islam, that he has become Muslim.

And the list goes on of some of the most noble companions that were in that batch of Abyssinia that would make hijrah to Abyssinia. , the Prophet  is putting a lot into this migration by the types of people that he is sending, and Quraysh know that the stakes are high as well. He says that we preceded you to the migration. For him and his companions have only one hijrah and you are the people of two hijrahs.”  the Prophet  rules in the favour of Asma’, the wife of Ja'far in that sense and says you are the people of two hijrahs. Hijrah wipes away everything that comes before it.

And it's as if the Prophet  knew, he was giving an indication that this was going to be a difficult battle, a battle that was not  the other battles that they would experience. they go to fight the Byzantines in this battle in Mu'tah. Ja'far  assumes the command and Ja'far, who had just made the hijrah to Medina to be in the companionship of the Prophet , is experiencing this difficult battle and he fights  bravely. She knows that the army is on its way back from battle.
