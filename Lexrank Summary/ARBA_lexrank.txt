And we also find that once, as the Prophet  was preparing to dispatch a force, a mission, and Rasulullah  asked for people to sponsor it, that Abdurahman ibn Auf goes home and he brings back 2,000 coins for the Prophet  and Rasulullah  says, “What have you left behind?” He , “O Rasulullah, I give 2,000 for the sake of Allah and I left 2,000 for my family.”  giving half of your wealth for an expedition is pretty significant and this is something that he constantly would do with the Prophet  in multiple expeditions. And if Allah  gives you victory, then propose to the daughter of the chief of the tribe.” This was a very specific advice that the Prophet  gave to him,, and of course this was a way of softening the hearts of tribes that were hostile and bringing people together. Abdurahman ibn Auf did what he was told and he married the daughter of the chief of the tribe and through that marriage, his most prominent son was born, and that was Abu Salama ibn Abdurahman ibn Auf, who would go on to become one of the seven jurists of Medina who were famous.

Abdurrahman Ibn Auf is again one of the first 10 or 15 to accept Islam before Dar al-Arqam, and who would know the Prophet  before the Prophet  would formally start to gather the people and teach them. We also find that one of the rulings of accepting jizya from the Zoroastrians was also taken from Abdurrahman ibn Auf, who , “I heard it from the Prophet  and saw it from the Prophet .”  the ruling of jizya from Ahlul Kitab was not specific to Ahlul Kitab, but applied to these other religious communities as well, that they would be protected under the jizya.

He stayed under the radar in Mecca, but he was persecuted, and we see that Abdurrahman Ibn Auf was one of those who made the first migration to Abyssinia and then came back, and he stayed back in Mecca until the migration to Al-Madinah. last week we talked about Abu Ubaidah , who only made the second migration to Abyssinia, and this week we talk about Abdurrahman Ibn Auf, who only made the first migration to Abyssinia and came back and spent time with the Prophet  and waited until the order to migrate to Al-Madinah. And we see that the Prophet   appointed him to lead one of those missions, and something significant that happened and this was the fifth year of Hijrah that as the Prophet  was dispatching him, the Prophet  took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself.

--- Battle Summary ---

Rather we find that he participated in every battle with the Prophet ,  he did not take a posture of ‘O Rasulullah, I'm wealthy and I'm not going to go out and battle or get my clothes dirty alongside you.’ Instead we find that he maintained a closeness to the Prophet  in battle just  all of the 10 promised paradise. some of the stories that we have from him in battle, one of them if you remember when we talked about Bilal . And we also find that once, as the Prophet  was preparing to dispatch a force, a mission, and Rasulullah  asked for people to sponsor it, that Abdurahman ibn Auf goes home and he brings back 2,000 coins for the Prophet  and Rasulullah  says, “What have you left behind?” He , “O Rasulullah, I give 2,000 for the sake of Allah and I left 2,000 for my family.”  giving half of your wealth for an expedition is pretty significant and this is something that he constantly would do with the Prophet  in multiple expeditions. And we see that the Prophet   appointed him to lead one of those missions, and something significant that happened and this was the fifth year of Hijrah that as the Prophet  was dispatching him, the Prophet  took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself. just think of the scene and as he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf, he put his hand on his head , and he made dua for him and as he made dua for him, he advised him to have taqwa, as the Prophet  would always do when he sends someone out on a military mission.

And Khalid  was new to Islam and Khalid   some words to Abdurrahman ibn Auf as they were arguing in the wake of a battle, and the Prophet  was saying to Khalid , “Do not curse my companions or abuse my companions.”  of course, for us, this applies to all of the sahaba of the Prophet , but when the Prophet  spoke to the sahaba, there were of course degrees amongst the sahaba and the Prophet  always gave preference to the firsts and those that came to Islam early on. There are other narrations about his virtues and they are plentiful and I'll go through some of my favourite and I could literally go all night talking about Abdurrahman ibn Auf, and how the companions spoke about this man that was  generous with his wealth and generous with his heart and generous with his spirit. the generous know the generous.

And Mus'ab was killed, and he had nothing to cover him at his death except for the garment that he had for his death. And it was Abdurrahman ibn Auf  , “I heard from the Prophet , that if a person is in a land and plague breaks out, they should not leave it, and if they are not in that land, then they should not go to it.”  it was he who intervened in that regard. , they're all in this illustrious category of being from the 10 that were promised paradise, and one of the narrations is that Uthman  once became sick, and he wrote in his will that if he passed away in this illness that Abdurrahman ibn Auf would be his successor. he immediately , “Oh Allah, if that's the case, if I'm going to be his successor, let me die before he dies.
