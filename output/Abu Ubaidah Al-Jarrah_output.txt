--- Lineage Overview ---
When we talk about Abu Ubaidah al-jarrah  this is a man that was  elevated and  high in the eyes of the companions of the prophet  and the prophet  himself but we don't often talk about him in the capacity of the rest of the ten promised paradise and I think that as people sort of go through the names of the ten promised paradise there are always a few names that are forgotten  often forgotten when people are trying to recount those ten names.
Obviously, you get the four khulafa, and then you have some of the more prominent names the more well-known names, and then usually it's Abu Ubaidah or Sa'eed ibn Zayd that would be left out of the ten.
First and foremost, his name is  Amir ibn Abdillah ibn al-Jarrah,  his first name is Amir, his father's name is Abdullah, his grandfather is al-Jarrah, and we'll talk about why we don't refer to him as ibn Abdillah but instead as ibn al-Jarrah in a minute.
He is one of the tribes of Quraysh, or his sub tribe belongs to Quraysh but it is a far out tribe.
He's from the tribe known as Banu al-Harith ibn Fihr, and it is a distant tribe from the Prophet .
Not a powerful tribe or an influential tribe in Meccan politics, even though it is from Quraysh.
he has the benefit of being a Qurashi, but at the same time, his tribe is not  Banu Hashim or Bani Umayyah or some of the other very powerful tribes that we have been speaking about.
let's talk about his name for a bit, why is he Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and not Abu Ubaidah ibn Abdillah?
There are three reasons that scholars mentioned for the potential of skipping his father's name when we call him the son of al-Jarrah.
One of them is that it could be that his grandfather played more of a fatherly role in his life  when the Prophet  mentions that I am the son of Abdul Muttalib.
Then that's one reason that they  that perhaps it is that Abdul Muttalib spent more time with the Prophet  than his own father who passed away before he was born.
it could be that al-Jarrah  raised him as his grandfather, and that's one possibility.
The second one is that sometimes and it also goes back to the same narration about the Prophet  saying I am the son of Abdul Muttalib, sometimes the more well known of the two, meaning if the grandfather was more well known than the father, because the grandfather is technically still a father, then a person will be known by the grandfather's name rather than the father.
The third reason is one that will be understood in the capacity of this biography is that if the father was humiliated or known for something very negative,  if the grandfather was known for something exceedingly positive or the father was known for something exceedingly negative, then sometimes a person would go by the name of the grandfather rather than the father in either of those two instances.
who is his mother?
His mother her name was Umayma, but her lineage is disputed and according to Ibn Hajar, though we don't have any information on her, she is  considered one who accepted Islam.
his father certainly is not amongst those that accepted Islam, his mother may have accepted Islam according to some narrations.
He also has a brother by the name of Yazid, who did convert to Islam and is considered a sahabi, may Allah be pleased with him, but we don't have much information about him at all.
Abu Ubaidah  grew up in a family of archers, and he was a skilled talented military general without ever having led an army.
And  you'll find that some of the writers will mention that he was tortured by his father  severely that he was almost killed.
We find that there are some narrations that suggest that he played a role in assisting in the boycott, but even that is somewhat ambiguous, that he was helping gather the food for the tribe of the Prophet  under the boycott.
And his brother from the Ansar when he made hijrah was the great Mu'adh ibn Jabal .
And one of the things that's mentioned about the Battle of Badr in particular is his father.
That people had to fight against their family members for the very first time.
Some of the sahaba had to fight their brothers,  Musab had to fight his brother Ubaidullah.
Many of them had to fight their uncles and their fathers.
When it came to Abu Ubaidah, one of the narrations that we find that is commonly mentioned is that his own father was after him in battle and that his own father wanted to sacrifice him.
And what this suggests is that his father was after him in Badr and he was avoiding his father throughout the battle, but eventually his father ambushed him.
He had a singular mission in Badr, which was to kill his son, and Abu Ubaidah, instead defending himself, had to kill his father.
And when he did that, he was in a state of obvious grief and did not know what would happen to him and that's where some of the commentators of the Quran mention that Surah Al-Mujadilah verse 22 was revealed in response that the messenger of Allah was more beloved to these people than their own family members.
And when they were put in that situation where their own family members had come out against them to kill them, Allah  had removed any burden from them in that regard.
again, that entire incident between him and his father in Badr is one that is a difficult one.
But nonetheless, we find that Abu Ubaidah ,  the other companions of the Prophet  was put in a difficult situation in which he had to fight against his own family members.
And their names were Al-Aqib and Al-Syed.
In fact, any descendants that he would have had there are practically nothing about his family life, and any descendants that he had were believed to have died along with him in what we will talk about in the Amwas plague.
We don't seek the leadership of this world and we don't work for this world, but instead, we are all brothers for the sake of Allah .‚Äù  Abu Ubaidah  waited until after the battle, and then it was known that Abu Ubaidah was the commander, the general, but at times, Khalid  is still appointed to lead specific missions and armies.
And then Abu Ubaidah  appoints Mu'adh ibn Jabal , his brother in the hijrah, and he dies.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
His mother her name was Umayma, but her lineage is disputed and according to Ibn Hajar, though we don't have any information on her, she is  considered one who accepted Islam.
his father certainly is not amongst those that accepted Islam, his mother may have accepted Islam according to some narrations.
Now, when did he accept Islam?
He was a teenager, 18 or 19 years old, and he's considered one of the first ten people to accept Islam.
Abu Ubaidah  is considered to be from that first group of people who accepted Islam at the hands of whom?
He embraces Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, amongst the first group that were given da'wah by Abu Bakr, and he immediately accompanies the Prophet  and becomes one from the people of Dar al-Arqam.
But you find some incidents where the Prophet  himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet , beyond the fact that he is one of the people of Badr, that he is one of the earliest that accepted Islam, that he is one of the people that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle.

--- Persecution ---
Now, other than that, when it comes to his Meccan life, there isn't much that is talked about at all, in fact, except that he was tortured and that he was patient.
And  you'll find that some of the writers will mention that he was tortured by his father  severely that he was almost killed.
Some of them  that one of the reasons why there's such silence on him in Meccan seerah, which generally is not covered as much as the seerah in Medina, is because he went into hiding because of the severity of the persecution.
When you're there, imagine the scenes of persecution and imagine the scene of victory because they're both very important when you're there.
There are long years of persecution of the Messenger , where as you're sitting there around the Kaaba, you can look around and you can imagine some of those narrations about the Prophet  first being persecuted around the Kaaba and all of these wonderful companions that we have covered, may Allah be pleased with them all.

--- Hijra ---
And even his hijrah to Abyssinia is there's no information except that he is amongst those that made the hijrah, the second migration to Abyssinia.
And Al-Dhahabi says if he indeed made that migration, that it wasn't for long.
He went to Abyssinia; he gained the reward of making hijrah to Abyssinia because there's a reward in hijrah, and he returned to Mecca for some time until he made hijrah to Medina as well.
And his brother from the Ansar when he made hijrah was the great Mu'adh ibn Jabal .
he gained one of the great distinctions amongst the companions was to be from amongst those that made the two migrations.
And then Abu Ubaidah  appoints Mu'adh ibn Jabal , his brother in the hijrah, and he dies.

--- Battle ---
He learned all of the crafts that have to do with the army and warfare, even though he had never  led one before.
He knew how to ride his horse and shoot moving targets at the same time.
He had huge arms to where he was capable with his sword and capable with his bow and arrow, capable on a horse, capable on foot.
Abu Ubaidah , as a young man, in fact they  that by the time he was six, he could already handle a bow and arrow, and by the time he was twelve, he was already more skilled than the most skilled warrior.
He went to Abyssinia; he gained the reward of making hijrah to Abyssinia because there's a reward in hijrah, and he returned to Mecca for some time until he made hijrah to Medina as well.
He gained that distinction, he would be amongst those who fought in every battle alongside the Prophet  in some capacity as a general, which is something that is an added layer of uniqueness for him.
he didn't just fight alongside the Prophet  in every battle.
But every battle that he fought in, he held some position as a general holding a banner, leading alongside the Prophet .
he was memorizing the Quran as it was being revealed in Mecca, and he had a special attachment to the Quran, which reminds us of Salim  and the way that these people combined their love of the Quran with their love of the Prophet  and fighting alongside the Prophet  and defending him.
he's extremely skilled in battle, and the stories about him in battle are stories that display his position with the Prophet  and what a hero he was considered.
And one of the things that's mentioned about the Battle of Badr in particular is his father.
Remember that the Battle of Badr is known as the day that distinguished and the day of criterion.
That people had to fight against their family members for the very first time.
Some of the sahaba had to fight their brothers,  Musab had to fight his brother Ubaidullah.
Many of them had to fight their uncles and their fathers.
When it came to Abu Ubaidah, one of the narrations that we find that is commonly mentioned is that his own father was after him in battle and that his own father wanted to sacrifice him.
And what this suggests is that his father was after him in Badr and he was avoiding his father throughout the battle, but eventually his father ambushed him.
He had a singular mission in Badr, which was to kill his son, and Abu Ubaidah, instead defending himself, had to kill his father.
But nonetheless, we find that Abu Ubaidah ,  the other companions of the Prophet  was put in a difficult situation in which he had to fight against his own family members.
Even when the battle seemed to be lost at that point and they were putting their bodies on the line in front of the Prophet  as the arrows were coming towards him, as the swords were swinging at the Prophet , as all of these difficult strikes were coming to the Messenger of Allah .
But you find some incidents where the Prophet  himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet , beyond the fact that he is one of the people of Badr, that he is one of the earliest that accepted Islam, that he is one of the people that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle.
He was a soldier, and he saw his life as being a soldier in the service of the Messenger , and he lives his life in mission after mission after mission, being deployed by the Prophet  and then Abu Bakr and Umar.
And there are a few of these missions that are narrated.
One of them is that when the Prophet  sent him and Amr ibn al-As  on a mission, he  to them, ‚ÄúDo not differ amongst yourselves in terms of leadership.‚Äù Now, Amr was a new convert to Islam.
But because the Prophet  did not assign a leader between Abu Ubaidah and Amr, may Allah be pleased with them, as soon as they leave, when they're on the way, Amr says to Abu Ubaidah that, ‚ÄúListen, I'm leading this army and you're following me.‚Äù  Amr insists upon his leadership position and Abu Ubaidah immediately gives it to him and he  even puts Amr forward to lead the salah, even though Amr was a new Muslim.
he puts Amr forward, Amr  leads this army and Abu Ubaidah  follows and he has absolutely no complaint in that regard.
The Prophet  deploys him in multiple missions especially in those last years where it started to move beyond just what was taking place in the immediate vicinity of Medina and Mecca.
Jabir ibn Abdillah , he says that Rasulullah  sent a group of us to the sea on a mission on the sea and he appointed Abu Ubaidah al-Jarrah as our leader.
imagine they're in battle, they're on a mission, and they only have a date to sustain themselves on a daily basis.
it came to a point where we didn't even have that one tamr that we would look forward to that one date every day.
Of course Abu Bakr is appointed and while Abu Bakr is appointed, Abu Ubaidah  spends his life under Abu Bakr doing what he does best in missions and at war in battle with the Byzantines in particular, fighting alongside the borders of a greater Syria.
Meaning they put more trust in the sword of Khalid than in Allah ,  he replaced Khalid ibn Walid  with Abu Ubaidah al-Jarrah and Abu Ubaidah received this in the middle of battle and he didn't tell Khalid  away because the battle was about to start and he did not want to disrupt the battle or Khalid's plan.
He didn't want to mess things up,  he waited until after the battle, and then he conveyed what was conveyed to him through that letter to Khalid, and Khalid  says, ‚ÄúMay Allah have mercy on you, O Abu Ubaidah.
We don't seek the leadership of this world and we don't work for this world, but instead, we are all brothers for the sake of Allah .‚Äù  Abu Ubaidah  waited until after the battle, and then it was known that Abu Ubaidah was the commander, the general, but at times, Khalid  is still appointed to lead specific missions and armies.
The famous battle of Yarmouk was the most famous battle of Khalid , and they really became a great complement to each other.
Khalid, when he met with the leaders of other armies and other groups, he immediately escalated, and it went straight to battle.
Because they were both brilliant in battle, that Damascus was conquered at the same time by Abu Ubaidah and Khalid.
You remained intact from everything that came to you of this world, remained focused and upon the mission of the Prophet .
And  all of us will die, and the smartest amongst us is the one who is most humble to their Lord, or who obeys their Lord most, and who works towards the hereafter, or to the inevitable most.‚Äù And there is a long beautiful wasiah of Abu Ubaidah  reminding the people to remember Allah  to hold on to their deeds.
JazakumAllahu Khayran Wasalamualikoum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.

--- Virtue(s) ---
Everyone and welcome back to the first.
He was a teenager, 18 or 19 years old, and he's considered one of the first ten people to accept Islam.
Again, you're going to keep on seeing people that are within the first 10, 15, or 20.
He embraces Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, amongst the first group that were given da'wah by Abu Bakr, and he immediately accompanies the Prophet  and becomes one from the people of Dar al-Arqam.
And he is also one of the first to memorize the Quran.
But you find some incidents where the Prophet  himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet , beyond the fact that he is one of the people of Badr, that he is one of the earliest that accepted Islam, that he is one of the people that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle.
the next day, as they are praying in the first line, as they are making their appearances known to the Prophet , their presence known to the Messenger , the Prophet  says, ‚ÄúStand up, O Abu Ubaidah.‚Äù And the Prophet   that, ‚ÄúEvery ummah has an ameen, and the trustworthy one of this ummah is Abu Ubaidah.‚Äù Now remember when we talked about Az-Zubayr , the Prophet   every prophet has a disciple and my disciple is Az-Zubayr .
Though it would be understood that Abu Ubaidah  because of his seniority, his being amongst the first, his being a people of Badr, his being someone who lost his teeth in service of the Messenger  and Uhud, being a memorizer of Quran, that he would be amongst those, or he would be considered the natural leader.
Abu Bakr  would not  that except that he has thought about it and he has taken a thoughtful decision  knowing who these people are, knowing the virtue of Umar and knowing the virtue of Abu Ubaidah, and he says that choose either one of them.
Umar  used to love him and used to honor him, he used to kiss his hand even as he was the khalifah when he would see him.
what then when he sees his companions, and when he sees people that he knows their virtue, Umar  would always shed tears.
I gave a lecture, a break from The Firsts, about the plague of Amwas.

--- Death ---
Then that's one reason that they  that perhaps it is that Abdul Muttalib spent more time with the Prophet  than his own father who passed away before he was born.
Abu Ubaidah  grew up in a family of archers, and he was a skilled talented military general without ever having led an army.
Abu Ubaidah , as a young man, in fact they  that by the time he was six, he could already handle a bow and arrow, and by the time he was twelve, he was already more skilled than the most skilled warrior.
And  you'll find that some of the writers will mention that he was tortured by his father  severely that he was almost killed.
Even after the death of the Prophet , Abu Ubaidah  was always in some capacity, a general in the army.
he's extremely skilled in battle, and the stories about him in battle are stories that display his position with the Prophet  and what a hero he was considered.
Even when the battle seemed to be lost at that point and they were putting their bodies on the line in front of the Prophet  as the arrows were coming towards him, as the swords were swinging at the Prophet , as all of these difficult strikes were coming to the Messenger of Allah .
Remember the Prophet  suffered numerous wounds on the day of Uhud, and he was almost killed, knocked into a ditch, teeth knocked out.
And you'll see exactly why, when we start to get to some of the incidents that took place with him after the death of the Messenger .
In fact, any descendants that he would have had there are practically nothing about his family life, and any descendants that he had were believed to have died along with him in what we will talk about in the Amwas plague.
that was his position with the Prophet , and when the Prophet  passed away, Abu Bakr al-sadiq , of course in the famous incident of going to the saqeefa, he takes with him Abu Ubaidah and Umar, may Allah be pleased with them.
And there are a few incidents narrated between Umar and Abu Ubaidah, and then we'll go to his death, may Allah be pleased with him.
then what happens to Abu Ubaidah , the plague breaks out and before COVID started, we didn't know the severity of COVID.
I gave a lecture, a break from The Firsts, about the plague of Amwas.
Abu Ubaidah had come to meet Umar outside of greater Syria, and as they were meeting outside of ash-sham on the border, the news came to them that the plague had struck and that people were dying  and left, and  the discussion then becomes should Umar  proceed to ash-sham or should he turn back.
Umar  is deliberating whether or not he should enter into ash-sham during that plague.
he  to Abu Ubaidah, ‚ÄúWe're fleeing from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah.‚Äù And Abdurrahman ibn Auf  intervenes, and he , ‚ÄúI have heard from the Prophet  directly that the Prophet   that if you hear of a plague that breaks out in the land, do not enter it, but if the plague breaks out while you are in that land, then do not leave it.‚Äù  the famous hadith that has been cited  much over the past year about quarantining and things of that sort,  this is the context of that, this discussion between Umar and Abu Ubaidah.
And the plague then started to ravage more people and Umar  was worried about some of his sahaba that were still there and at the top of that list was Abu Ubaidah .
This is what's implied here is that he just wants me to get away from the plague.
If I die in this plague, it's shahada, and I will be .
He  excuse me, and let me stay with my army and I'm pleased with the decree of Allah, and if I die in this plague, then it is shahada.
Abu Ubaidah is the one who narrates the famous hadith that if a person dies from a plague, that they're a martyr.
It's only a matter of time before he'll pass away.‚Äù 

Then Umar  responds to the letter, and he tells Abu Ubaidah to at least find a place that is secure and that's elevated  that the worst of the plague will not strike him, and  Abu Ubaidah  calls for Abu Musa al-Ashari.
Abu Musa  gets home and finds that his wife is struck with the plague.
Abu Ubaidah  takes his camel, starts to look for a place, and then he also struck by the plague and the people rushed to their leader, to Abu Ubaidah , who is the head of them all, he's the leader of Ash-Sham.
And as they surround him and he's dying, he says to them that, ‚ÄúIndeed, Allah  has written upon the child of Adam death.
And then Abu Ubaidah  appoints Mu'adh ibn Jabal , his brother in the hijrah, and he dies.
And when he dies, the people weep over the death of their leader of Abu Ubaidah al-Jarrah .
