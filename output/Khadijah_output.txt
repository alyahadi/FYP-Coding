--- Lineage Overview ---
But understanding the place of Zayd ibn Amr and then understanding Waraqah, the cousin of Khadijah and the role that he played and now we get to this very special woman.
From Qusay ibn Kilab all the way up, she has the exact same lineage as the Prophet .
, she has the same lineage as the Prophet peace be upon him, and then it breaks off after Qusay to Abdul Uzza, and then you go into the tree of Khadijah .
Her father, was he the oldest son or the youngest son?
Because her uncle, her uncle who?
Waraqah is her cousin but almost  her uncle because of the difference in age.
He was one of those who defended the Ka’bah in the story of Surat Al-Fil, one of those who was willing to defend the Ka’bah along with Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet .
And he also went with Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet  to Yemen to congratulate Saif ibn Dhiyazan, who became the ruler of Yemen after the death of Abrahah, and of course, Abrahah was the one who sought to destroy the Ka’bah from Yemen.
, the father of Khadijah, Khuwaylid, is close to Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet .
And of course, Abdul Muttalib was the one who took care of the Prophet  when he was first born because the Prophet's father had already passed away.
, Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather, and Khuwaylid have a history of being two chiefs living together, yet both of them died relatively early.
Who knows the name of the mother of Khadijah ?
I'll give you a clue, it's the name of one of her daughters, Fatima.
, the mother of Khadijah is Fatima bint Zaidah.
, Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet  and Khadijah al-Zahra is named after Fatima bint Zaidah.
Fatima was also the paternal grandmother of the Prophet , the mother of Abdullah.
Her siblings, we mentioned a very famous sibling, Awwam, being the father of Az-Zubayr .
Az-Zubayr bin Awwam of course is one of the ten promised paradise,  that would make Zubayr her cousin or nephew, we  her siblings.
Zubayr has two daughters by the way, named Khadijah al-Kubra and Khadijah al-Sughra.
Would name two of his daughters, Khadijah the big and Khadijah the small.
Another famous sibling is Hizam, the father of Hakim ibn Hizam, who of course, was the one who played a big role in the seerah of the Prophet .
There is Hala bint Khuwaylid, the sister of Khadijah .
that's one of the sisters of Khadijah  as well.
Khadijah  was born 15 years before the Prophet .
The Prophet  was born in the year 570.  she was born in the year 555, 15 years before the Prophet .
Her name is a really interesting name.
It's an extremely unique name.
If you look through the early books where they track the names, the names that people would use in the Arab world at the time were pretty common.
You see a lot of aunts, moms, and daughters kind of recycling the names over and over and over again.
Khadijah is not one of those names.
Just  Muhammad  is unique only to him, Khadijah is not a name that you find.
And  the indication is that she was born well before the due date.
But as a girl, when she was born, she was born premature.
Hence her family called her Khadijah.
she was born a very premature birth, given the name Khadijah.
She has another nickname.
her nickname was Tahira.
Khadijah was also called Tahira, pure, before Islam.
She married a man by the name of Abu Hala ibn Zurarah At-Tamimi, that's her first husband.
Men and women named Hind.
She had a daughter from him named Hind also,  a son from the first one named Hind.
Second husband, she had a daughter named Hind.
Also a son named Abdul Uzza, obviously a reference to idolatry, but this one, that doesn't come in any sound narration per se, but some of the books mention a son by the name of Abdul Uzza, and that would not be because of her idol worshipper proving of idolatry, but it would be because that was the name of her grandfather.
Banu Makhzum is considered one of the richest tribes.
Her nickname becomes the princess of Quraysh, the leader of the women of Quraysh, Khadijah the Great.
There are  many different nicknames that she acquires along the way, aside from Tahira, which was one that was more prominent and interchangeable with her name, Khadijah, growing up.
And she was complaining to her sister Hala about this.
the Prophet  was a shepherd for Hala, the sister of Khadijah.
She , approach his father, Abu Talib.
Abu Talib, of course, is the uncle of the Prophet , but plays the role of his father.
And the person that would be paired off with him, as we  last week, what was his name?
Does anyone know her name?
He had a poor family.
He wanted to take care of his family.
Again, this is a situation where you have the family living together, different kids, the kids of Abu Talib being transferred here, living with the Prophet .
He says, , I have to take care for my family, I have to take care of them, but who would you suggest anyway?
Their nicknames, Tahira and Al-Amin.
Who at that time was not called the father of ignorance, he was Amr ibn Hisham, Abu al-Hakam, the father of wisdom, powerful, strong, noble.
Was it because of his lineage?
Lineage was a big thing to the Arabs.
Who can name all the children by the way?
According to a narration from Urwa, Khadijah named the girls, the Prophet  named the boys.
When Khadijah met Halima Sa'diyah and she saw the way the Prophet  loved Halima Sa'diyah  a mother, Khadijah  gifted her with 40 sheep and a camel.
Of course, one of the significant incidents before revelation here is when the tribes fought over the placement of the stone in the Ka'bah.
And the tribes made an agreement that they would resolve the dispute by whoever walks through the doors next will place the stone together.
He  that all of the tribes will put the black stone in the cloth.
And all of the tribes will grab a part of that cloth.
And  it solves the dispute of giving favouritism to one tribe over the other.
His family life is good.
Sometimes he would tell his family what he saw in the dream.
The worship of Waraqah was called Tahannuf, to worship in a Hanifi way.
But he was called very specifically to that cave in Hira.
He could have gone to Abu Talib, his father figure.
The Prophet  could have gone to Hamza , his uncle and one of his best friends.
Hamza plays a dual role of being his uncle.
She could have called someone over.
He hadn't been called at this point.
As a woman, obviously she's the cousin of Waraqah, she's a wise woman, a noble woman, but she's figuring things out herself, and she is guided naturally towards this goodness.
But when the boycott happens, when the boycott happened, the boycott was of two tribes, Banu Hashim and Banu Mutallib.
Khadijah's not included in either of those tribes.
Your father figure, the only person who protected you and cared for you, he dies.
Called her the old woman, toothless woman of Quraysh.
This is beautiful because our mother Aisha narrates this to show the virtues of Khadijah.
That this is the mother of my children, she's all this to me.
And when Hala, the sister of Khadijah, when the Prophet  would hear her voice, the Prophet  would peak.
I'm not going to treat my uncle al-Abbas or my son-in-law differently.
anyway, she's the first mother of the believers.
We ask Allah to gather us with him , with our first mother and his first love Khadijah .

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
Abu Talib accepts the proposition.
The Prophet  accepts to take her caravan to Ash-Sham for that year.
Three people who would oppose, of course, the only one who lived to accept Islam would be Abu Sufyan.
Tells Khadijah , cover me, hold me, embrace me.
The Prophet  comes in, sweating, he's shaking, hold me, embrace me.
She holds him, she embraces him, she comforts him, .
Khadijah  embraced the Prophet , though this time there is a history that happened some time ago, where she knew what must have happened.
And Surat al-Muddathir is revealed in her arms , and after Surat al-Muddathir came, the Prophet  , “You are the first one I'm calling to this message.” and Khadijah  , “And I am the first one to accept this message.” I'm not going to question it.
Complete acceptance of that which she has.
When the Prophet  saw the necklace of Khadijah , the Prophet's daughter Zaynab al-Kubra was married to Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi', and Abu al-As was a good man, but he didn't accept Islam because of tribal affiliations.

--- Persecution ---
The persecution that led to the death of Khadijah.

--- Hijra ---
He lived all the way until 36 after Hijrah.

--- Battle ---
As I  you could start off with her and we could have started off the series, but I wanted to kind of lay the groundwork with some of those that started to have these inclinations towards belief before Khadijah  receives the Prophet  and believes in him and gives him that support that he needed  desperately in those times.
But understanding the place of Zayd ibn Amr and then understanding Waraqah, the cousin of Khadijah and the role that he played and now we get to this very special woman.
Waraqah is the oldest son of Naufal, and Khadijah is the youngest of Khuwaylid, which explains the gap in age between Waraqah and Khadijah.
Waraqah really played much more of a senior role in her life.
Waraqah is her cousin but almost  her uncle because of the difference in age.
We're talking at least at this point, 25 to 30 years between Waraqah and Khadijah .
Khuwaylid died, as we  last week, in the battle of Al-Fijar.
Part of that is probably the influence of Waraqah bin Naufal who we spoke about last week.
If you remember from the story of Waraqah, Abu Talib took him as a child, and the monk in Syria , don't bring him around here.
Come on, Waraqah.
And Waraqah told Khadijah that this would be, that you would marry a noble man or a prophet.
The worship of Waraqah was called Tahannuf, to worship in a Hanifi way.
He could have gone to Waraqah, a person who understands these things himself.
She could have immediately  let's go to Waraqah.
Allah says, righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West, but righteousness is one who believes in Allah, the last day, the angels, the book, the Prophets, and gives out of their wealth, in spite of their love for it, to relatives, to orphans, to the needy, to the travellers, to those who ask for help, for the freeing of slaves, and who establishes prayer and gives zakat, those who fulfil their promises when they make promises and those who are patient in poverty and hardship and during struggle.
She says let's go to Waraqah.
That was her idea to go to Waraqah.
And by the way, we mentioned Waraqah made this comment and  that if I live to see when your people run you out, I will support you with everything I have.
I'll stand by your side and fight along your side.
You think Khadijah  sitting there hearing Waraqah  that didn't affect her?
that's going to be my mission then.
It is what Waraqah desired to do, that Khadijah  would do.
As a woman, obviously she's the cousin of Waraqah, she's a wise woman, a noble woman, but she's figuring things out herself, and she is guided naturally towards this goodness.
That the tribulations that are going to come, that Waraqah warned of, certainly those tribulations will come.
And  he fought on the day of Badr but he didn't fight hard.
May Allah reward her for her sacrifice.
May Allah reward her for her struggle.

--- Virtue(s) ---
We talk about Khadijah  and Khadijah is the first and the first and the first and the first and the first and the first.
In fact, if you were to break down the list of firsts, Khadijah would occupy the first nine which I'll get to, at least about the first nine if you  get to her virtues.
Now my disclaimer for this is that I've done a five hour class on Khadijah,  it's very hard to condense into 40 minutes but I'm going to try to focus particularly on where she distinguishes herself as the first.
She had a daughter from him named Hind also,  a son from the first one named Hind.
she was an extremely generous woman as well.
That's why he didn't want to get married in the first place.
That's not taking into consideration the walk to the mountain in the first place.
But,  away, what are the first words she says?
And I went through all the narrations, I studied all 19 narrations, I was , let me find what the first word was.
Remember, this was one of the qualities that made her want to marry the Prophet  in the first place.
And this here makes Khadijah  not just the first believer.
This was the first time he saw Jibreel AS in his full angelic form, sitting on a throne between the heavens and the earth, covering the entirety of the horizon, and coming near the Prophet , and the Prophet  ran back to Khadijah , once again , zamiluni.
when the Prophet  sees Jibreel in human form the first time, he goes to her.
And Surat al-Muddathir is revealed in her arms , and after Surat al-Muddathir came, the Prophet  , “You are the first one I'm calling to this message.” and Khadijah  , “And I am the first one to accept this message.” I'm not going to question it.
she is the first Muslim, the first believer, the first of many things as I'll .
And then obviously in the last moments of Khadijah, when she's about to die, this woman who believed in him, gave him everything, loved him, supported him, encouraged him, now 25 years.
Another first, the first person to receive salam from Allah in this ummah.
This is beautiful because our mother Aisha narrates this to show the virtues of Khadijah.
To show the virtues of Khadijah and the character of the Prophet .
, you talk about the first.
anyway, she's the first mother of the believers.
The first Muslim.
The first one to receive salam from Allah.
The first one to receive salam from Jibreel AS.
The first one to worship with the Prophet  in prayer.
The first one to do Tawaf with the Prophet .

--- Death ---
And he also went with Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet  to Yemen to congratulate Saif ibn Dhiyazan, who became the ruler of Yemen after the death of Abrahah, and of course, Abrahah was the one who sought to destroy the Ka’bah from Yemen.
And of course, Abdul Muttalib was the one who took care of the Prophet  when he was first born because the Prophet's father had already passed away.
her first husband, Abu Hala, passed away.
Now this one, this husband passed away also, and he died when she was only 25,  she was already widowed twice at the age of 25 years old, meaning that she would go 15 years, 15 years unmarried after being married to two husbands before the Prophet .
it gives you some context to the Prophet  repaying that favour later on after the death of Khadijah.
Your father figure, the only person who protected you and cared for you, he dies.
And then your emotional support, your mental support, your love, Khadijah  dies  after at the age of 65.
, she  passed away in Ramadan, in that year of 620, and they were married at that point for 25 years.
Ammar ibn Yasir says that we feared for the Prophet  after her death, that he would die soon after, from the amount of grief that he had, , when she passed away.
And even after she passed away, most of the narrations about Khadijah are from Aisha .
And she  every day, 13 years after his death, she  wallahi a day did not pass except that he mentioned her.
The persecution that led to the death of Khadijah.
