--- Lineage Overview ---
, Saad ibn Abi Waqqas  is from the tribe of Zuhra, Banu Zuhra.
And he is related to the Prophet  specifically through his grandfather, who is the brother of the father of the mother of the Prophet .
The Prophet 's mother of course is Amina bint Wahab and Saad 's grandfather is Wahab, the brother of Wahab.
Wahab and Wahab are brothers, hence the Prophet  would , “This is my maternal uncle”.
When he would look at Saad,  let one of you show me his maternal uncle.
Who can have an uncle  this?
Saad  is related to the Prophet  once again; he is his maternal uncle in that sense.
But of course, when we  he is the uncle, it is only in that sense, and he was a teenager when the Prophet  received revelation.
His nickname was Abu Ishaq.
, if  someone who is named Saad who is also Abu Ishaq, this is, of course, very common, especially with some of the mashayikh.
He was a teenager; his father had already passed away.
Despite, of course, not coming from a lowly tribe.
He ,  I went quickly to the streets of Ajyad, and I found Abu Bakr as-Siddiq , and Abu Bakr  called me to Islam, and  I accepted Islam, and he was amongst the first to accept Islam in that sense.
, he's one of those who embraced Islam through Abu Bakr, and he was a teenager, and he was unmarried, and he lived with his mother.
, Saad  goes, accepts Islam with the Prophet , and then he goes home to tell his mother that he accepted Islam.
Now, when he tells his mother that he accepted Islam, his mother goes into an extreme fit of anger and she starts to chastise him and she says, “What is this religion that you have embraced that took you away from the religion of your mother and your father?” And she yells at him, she shows a lot of rage and Saad  insists that, “This is the religion of Allah , that this is the religion of God, that the Prophet  is a messenger of Allah.” And she knows that she cannot argue with him in that sense.
You're going to be consumed with regret and remorse, and the people will condemn you forever.” Think about the guilt, and Saad loves his mother.
Saad  loves his mother.
, Saad  says, “Oh my mother, don't do it.
Oh, my mother, stop.” He pleads with her.
He's trying, “Oh, my mother, don't do this to yourself,”.
And she keeps on saying, “Not until you abandon your religion.” And eventually, Saad , he comes to a point where he says, “Oh mother, as much as I love you, my love for Allah and the Messenger of Allah is stronger.” And he tells her, he says, “Even if you had a hundred souls and they departed one after the other, then I would not give up my religion.
Oh, mother, I believe in this.
I love Allah and I love the Messenger .”  eventually, when his mother saw that that type of guilt-tripping him and causing him that emotional pain was not going to work, his mother gave up starving herself and hurting herself.
, there's something about the mother for her child, ?
This is a mother who at the end of the day has love for her child and has rights upon her child.
Did Allah  reveal Quran censoring the mother of Saad or talking bad about her or insulting her?
Treat your mother with excellence.
And Allah  in Surah Luqman, which is what most of the scholars  was revealed specifically regarding the incident of Saad , was again mentioning the goodness of the mother and the obedience that is owed to the parents.
Saad  with his mother.
We find that in the story of Abu Huraira  and his mother and others as well who were guilted in a very different way by their parents when they embraced Islam.
And  you find that two firsts that are given to Saad  is he's the first to fight in the name of Islam in the sense that there was an incident in which some of the Muslims went to pray in one of the valleys.
One of them was the little brother of Saad  who embraced Islam late in Mecca and made hijrah along with Saad  and his name was Umair ibn Abi Waqqas and he was  young at the battle of Badr, a teenager at the point of the battle of Badr that  the Prophet  did not want to let him accompany the battle or accompany the Muslims in the battle of Badr.
May my mother and father be sacrificed for you.” This is something that's  to the Prophet .
, that the companions would  to the Prophet , “May my mother and father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah.” But the Prophet   to Saad  on that day, “Throw your arrows, O Saad.
May my mother and father be sacrificed for you.” Ali  who of course knows the Prophet  and grew up with the Prophet  and has that close relationship to the Messenger , he  about that saying of the Prophet  he  “The Prophet  never combined his mother and father in a statement  that except for Saad ibn Abi Waqqas.” When he  to him, “Shoot, O young man.
May my mother and father be sacrificed for you.” This is narrated from another companion as well.
But instead provided for it's better not to leave your family in a way that they have to beg, but instead in a way that they're provided for and he  if you spend anything seeking the pleasure of Allah  you'll be rewarded for it even if it's a morsel which you place in your wife's mouth.
His father oppressed him for leaving their religion and for embracing at that time, at least  monotheistic form of Christianity and an early form of Christianity, which would eventually lead him to Islam.
And Salman  would be chained up and tortured in Persia by his own father, and would have to endure the pain of leaving those chains, escaping the chains of his father.
Saad  having to endure the pain of his mother, insisting upon him leaving Islam and enduring pain herself, which  caused him great pain.
And he lived that out  where, when he was called to fights that were internal, he wanted nothing to do with it.
And  there's a great lesson here that Saad  , “I did not sign up for this.” Go through all of this pain shoot arrows on behalf of the prophet , go through the emotional torture of having my mother do with me what she did when i embraced Islam, to fight my own and to use these to get involved in disunity and to get involved in the horrors of what was showing itself in the fitnah at the time.
Just  the prophet   that there would come a time of fitnah where it's better to just literally take your sheep, avoid everybody and just,  the greatest thing that you could do is just have your little share of wealth, take care of yourself, take care of your family and avoid it all.
And just to be from those that the Prophet  promised Jannah and from those who early on came to the Prophet  and would offer everything and gives us an example of one who would be hurt by his own mother in that regard for embracing Islam.
may Allah  gather us with him and with the blessed companions and the family of the Prophet  and the Prophet  in Jannatul Firdaus.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
He ,  I went quickly to the streets of Ajyad, and I found Abu Bakr as-Siddiq , and Abu Bakr  called me to Islam, and  I accepted Islam, and he was amongst the first to accept Islam in that sense.
Zayd  says, and I'm paraphrasing this part, but Zayd  says that no one embraced Islam before the day I embraced Islam, and no doubt I remained for seven days as one-third of the Muslims.
In the sense that he had, some of the ways to look at this is some of the scholars  he was the seventh person to accept Islam, but that he accepted Islam very early on and as we , you're going to find narrations  the ones of Lubaba  and Uthman  and others when we get to Ibn Mas'ud and Abu Dhar and others, may Allah be pleased with them all.
And the timing of their embrace of Islam is not as certain as the timing of Khadijah and Ali and Zayd and Abu Bakr.
anyway, when Saad accepts Islam, he's only a teenager.
This is also something to keep in mind that there is a thread with the 10 promised paradise, that half of them embraced Islam as teenagers, and half of them embraced Islam through Abu Bakr .
, he's one of those who embraced Islam through Abu Bakr, and he was a teenager, and he was unmarried, and he lived with his mother.
, Saad  goes, accepts Islam with the Prophet , and then he goes home to tell his mother that he accepted Islam.
Now, when he tells his mother that he accepted Islam, his mother goes into an extreme fit of anger and she starts to chastise him and she says, “What is this religion that you have embraced that took you away from the religion of your mother and your father?” And she yells at him, she shows a lot of rage and Saad  insists that, “This is the religion of Allah , that this is the religion of God, that the Prophet  is a messenger of Allah.” And she knows that she cannot argue with him in that sense.
Then she goes to the next step, and this gives us another layer of the early entrance into Islam, the people that accepted Islam early.
This is another layer to the early converts of Islam and may Allah  reward those who accept Islam and who go through these trials in  many different ways.
We find that in the story of Abu Huraira  and his mother and others as well who were guilted in a very different way by their parents when they embraced Islam.
One of them was the little brother of Saad  who embraced Islam late in Mecca and made hijrah along with Saad  and his name was Umair ibn Abi Waqqas and he was  young at the battle of Badr, a teenager at the point of the battle of Badr that  the Prophet  did not want to let him accompany the battle or accompany the Muslims in the battle of Badr.
And , he shows up and the Prophet  notices him and the Prophet  wants to send him home because he's  young and he insists  he keeps on hiding in the ranks and he cries and he begs the Prophet  to be alongside them and  the Prophet  eventually accepted Umair  to fight alongside the Muslims in the battle of Badr in which they were greatly outnumbered of course but Allah  gave them victory and Umair ibn Abi Waqqas, the brother of Saad  was one of the very few shuhada' of Badr.
And  there's a great lesson here that Saad  , “I did not sign up for this.” Go through all of this pain shoot arrows on behalf of the prophet , go through the emotional torture of having my mother do with me what she did when i embraced Islam, to fight my own and to use these to get involved in disunity and to get involved in the horrors of what was showing itself in the fitnah at the time.

--- Persecution ---
She's not going to torture Saad the way that some of the parents tortured their children.
She's not going to beat him or call for someone to physically torture him.
What she would do to him is probably worse, which is that she would torture herself to guilt him.
, she's not going to call anyone to torture him.
And Saad  was with a group of them when they were attacked, and Saad  was the first to strike one of them and to shed a drop of blood in defending the Prophet  in those early days of persecution.
And Salman  would be chained up and tortured in Persia by his own father, and would have to endure the pain of leaving those chains, escaping the chains of his father.
And  there's a great lesson here that Saad  , “I did not sign up for this.” Go through all of this pain shoot arrows on behalf of the prophet , go through the emotional torture of having my mother do with me what she did when i embraced Islam, to fight my own and to use these to get involved in disunity and to get involved in the horrors of what was showing itself in the fitnah at the time.

--- Hijra ---
In Badr, after he makes hijrah alongside the Prophet  and he would be amongst those that would witness every battle with the Prophet , he fought alongside the Messenger  bravely and he killed more than one person in the capacity of that battle and one of the shuhada of Badr.
One of them was the little brother of Saad  who embraced Islam late in Mecca and made hijrah along with Saad  and his name was Umair ibn Abi Waqqas and he was  young at the battle of Badr, a teenager at the point of the battle of Badr that  the Prophet  did not want to let him accompany the battle or accompany the Muslims in the battle of Badr.

--- Battle ---
, we talked about Khabbab and how skilled Khabbab  was in making fine swords for people.
This is another layer to the early converts of Islam and may Allah  reward those who accept Islam and who go through these trials in  many different ways.
And  you find that two firsts that are given to Saad  is he's the first to fight in the name of Islam in the sense that there was an incident in which some of the Muslims went to pray in one of the valleys.
In Badr, after he makes hijrah alongside the Prophet  and he would be amongst those that would witness every battle with the Prophet , he fought alongside the Messenger  bravely and he killed more than one person in the capacity of that battle and one of the shuhada of Badr.
In Uhud, you had over 70, and Badr, you had 12, 14, 15 who had passed away in total in the battle of Badr, and Allah knows best, but it's a small number of people.
One of them was the little brother of Saad  who embraced Islam late in Mecca and made hijrah along with Saad  and his name was Umair ibn Abi Waqqas and he was  young at the battle of Badr, a teenager at the point of the battle of Badr that  the Prophet  did not want to let him accompany the battle or accompany the Muslims in the battle of Badr.
And , he shows up and the Prophet  notices him and the Prophet  wants to send him home because he's  young and he insists  he keeps on hiding in the ranks and he cries and he begs the Prophet  to be alongside them and  the Prophet  eventually accepted Umair  to fight alongside the Muslims in the battle of Badr in which they were greatly outnumbered of course but Allah  gave them victory and Umair ibn Abi Waqqas, the brother of Saad  was one of the very few shuhada' of Badr.
And if you go visit Badr and you visit the shuhada', it's very emotional because it's such a different way that that graveyard is and of course the entire site of Badr from Mihjah onwards to Umair ibn Abi Waqqas they are listed and they are very far away from where people typically visit when they go for Hajj or for Umrah.
But he also continues to fight bravely alongside the Prophet  and particularly using the skill of archery.
Now of course archery was the advantage that the Muslims would have in their battles and we know that the reason why Uhud turned out the way that it did was because 40 of the archers came down before the Prophet  gave them permission to do  and that of course led to them being weak and vulnerable from the other side and  they did not have that advantage anymore with the archers.
While others held swords, Saad  was shooting one by one with the bow and arrow.
And there were some that were trying to defend the Prophet   Nusaybah  and Yazid ibn Sakin and others, may Allah be pleased with them, with their swords.
He says to Allah  in his dua, “O Allah, respond to Saad when he calls upon you.” And  Saad  now has this gift in which his duas are answered by Allah , and this is significant going forward in the life of Saad  because everyone knew that Saad's duas were mustajab.
But instead provided for it's better not to leave your family in a way that they have to beg, but instead in a way that they're provided for and he  if you spend anything seeking the pleasure of Allah  you'll be rewarded for it even if it's a morsel which you place in your wife's mouth.
And that is, of course, under the Persian Empire, he would be responsible for leading the Muslim army against the Persian Empire, who, of course, showed all sorts of aggression towards the Muslims.
When the battle ensued between the Muslims and the Persian Empire at the time.
But Allah  had other plans, and Saad  is leading the Muslims through some of the most devastating and harsh battles that would take place.
The famous battle of Qadisiyah, or the battle of the elephants, where Saad  came up with the strategy as the Persians employed elephants against the Muslims.
, Saad  took the Muslims through all of these different battles and particularly where the Prophet  mentioned that the palace of Kisra who had the largest palace in the world.
And one of the incidents that I think about in this regard, just from the journey of its starting that the last episode of this battle in which Saad   is able to conquer the palace of Madyan, the palace of Kisra.
And what you see with Saad  is that he was someone who wanted no part of the glory or the leadership or the struggles or the strife that would take place afterwards.
Saad  was not someone who wanted to be in charge, he was not someone that wanted glory and he certainly did not want to be a part of the fight that would take place later on, the various fights and the battles that would take place in the fitnah.
He narrated the hadith that to curse, to fight a muslim is kufr and to defame him is a form of evil doing, is a form of obscenity.
he avoided the fighting of the muslims, he avoided the defaming of the muslims he wanted nothing to do with that.
And he lived that out  where, when he was called to fights that were internal, he wanted nothing to do with it.
And  there's a great lesson here that Saad  , “I did not sign up for this.” Go through all of this pain shoot arrows on behalf of the prophet , go through the emotional torture of having my mother do with me what she did when i embraced Islam, to fight my own and to use these to get involved in disunity and to get involved in the horrors of what was showing itself in the fitnah at the time.
His position was well known but Saad  is someone who wants to spend his time in the da'wah, spend his time doing good, spend his time spreading Islam, not spend his time fighting the Muslims from within.
And the prophet  had warned him of that as well and there's something that you're finding by the way as a common theme that  many of these sahaba that would live to see these unfortunate times of disunity and dissension and the induced fitnah from the outside that led to all sorts of turmoil on the inside and confusion on the inside.

--- Virtue(s) ---
Tonight, we're going to be continuing with the first, and we now get into the life of Saad ibn Abi Waqqas , who, of course, is one of the ten that was promised paradise.
He ,  I went quickly to the streets of Ajyad, and I found Abu Bakr as-Siddiq , and Abu Bakr  called me to Islam, and  I accepted Islam, and he was amongst the first to accept Islam in that sense.
And  you find that two firsts that are given to Saad  is he's the first to fight in the name of Islam in the sense that there was an incident in which some of the Muslims went to pray in one of the valleys.
And Saad  was with a group of them when they were attacked, and Saad  was the first to strike one of them and to shed a drop of blood in defending the Prophet  in those early days of persecution.
The first to throw an arrow in Islam.
In Badr, after he makes hijrah alongside the Prophet  and he would be amongst those that would witness every battle with the Prophet , he fought alongside the Messenger  bravely and he killed more than one person in the capacity of that battle and one of the shuhada of Badr.
But he also continues to fight bravely alongside the Prophet  and particularly using the skill of archery.
The Prophet  and the companions are trying to give him as many arrows as possible because he's  precise, he's  quick, he's  brave in running around the Prophet  and trying to defend him in that regard.
This is one of the various virtues of Saad  was that he was one who used to give a lot of charity.

--- Death ---
Now, just  with some of the other companions, we're not going to cover in detail his life after the death of the Prophet , but just some of the qualities and how they played out as things went on.
, we talked about Khabbab and how skilled Khabbab  was in making fine swords for people.
He was a teenager; his father had already passed away.
In Badr, after he makes hijrah alongside the Prophet  and he would be amongst those that would witness every battle with the Prophet , he fought alongside the Messenger  bravely and he killed more than one person in the capacity of that battle and one of the shuhada of Badr.
In Uhud, you had over 70, and Badr, you had 12, 14, 15 who had passed away in total in the battle of Badr, and Allah knows best, but it's a small number of people.
Of course, you can give as much as you want before the time of death comes.
This was a cruel emperor the man who destroyed Jerusalem, killed 90,000 people in one day the man who had done  much harm to the world.
