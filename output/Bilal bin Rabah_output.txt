--- Lineage Overview ---
But I want us to think about the story of Bilal before Islam, because there's something about the message of the Prophet  that is resonating instantaneously with people that have been subjugated in the name of false gods.
Surat al-Fil reflects the incidents that would cause his mother to be brought into slavery and then Bilal to be raised in slavery in Mecca.
And amongst those that are captive, Bilal’s mother, Hamama, who was an Abyssinian princess.
He was born approximately 10 years after the year of the elephant, and of course, the year that the Prophet  was born as well.
he was born approximately in the year 580, making him a decade younger than the Prophet .
And we see the prominence of the story of Bilal and the name of Bilal in the ummah's history.
The nickname of Bilal was Aba Abdillah, though he never  had kids, according to most accounts.
This was a way to put Bilal down because of his status, despite having an Arab father.
Because as we , Bilal’s mother was an Abyssinian princess and Bilal’s father was a black Arab.
And in the famous narration with Abu Dharr saying those words, and of course some of the narrations suggesting that it was Bilal that he  those words to, it would make sense because it was a reminder that even though Bilal’s father was an Arab, his mother being an Abyssinian who was enslaved, is really what his status was reflective of.
And  Abu Dharr himself being a black Arab, saying that to Bilal, or the names being hurled at Bilal, the insult, specific insult to Bilal of ‘O son of a black woman’, is to suggest a lower status in society because at the end of the day, tribalism is what reigns supreme in that society.
Bilal was born into slavery.
And, , it's mentioned in some of the, in the accounts that Bilal, who loved his mother, used to witness his mother being beaten.
Listen, just , Allat wal Uzza, just  their names and this will end.
he's saying to him, just  Allat wal Uzza, just  the names of them and you will be free.
Name your price.
He's worth more to us than any price that he would have named.
Now, at that point, as the Prophet  tries to negotiate through his uncle Abu Talib, a means by which he can give da'wah to the leaders of Quraysh.
He says, “How come when you were being tortured, all you  was Ahadun Ahad, one, one?” , Bilal’s response was, “If I knew anything about Allah other than one, one, then I would have  it.” How simple the word, La ilaha illallah encapsulated in Ahadun Ahad, and Bilal does not know any other names of Allah, he doesn't call upon Allah with any du'a book, he doesn't have the names of Allah memorized.
He thrived off of his lineage and off of his access to power, but Umayyah was not one who  liked to be in battle or to be in confrontation.
The deal was that Abdurrahman ibn Auf was entrusted with the property and the wealth and the family of Umayyah ibn Khalaf in Medina, and Umayyah was entrusted with the wealth and the property and the family of Abdurrahman in Mecca.
And Umayyah did not accept the name of Abdurrahman.
His name before Islam was Abdu Amru.
And it's a gem of sorts, which is that Bilal would  marry the sister of Abdurrahman ibn Auf, Hala.
Abdurrahman would become the brother-in-law of Bilal later on.
And  that's a story that becomes within the family at that point of Bilal and Umayyah ibn Khalaf.
As for the brother of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Ubayy ibn Khalaf, Ubayy was the first person, the only person killed from the hand of the Prophet  in the battle of Uhud.
Bilal has the privilege of entering the Ka’bah with the Prophet , disposing of the very idols in whose name he was subjugated.
And according to Ibn Jawzi and others, this is where the verse in Surah Al-Hujurat, that, “Oh people, we have made you into male and female, nations and tribes, that you may get to know one another and verily, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah  is the one with the most piety.” And , Bilal has the privilege of climbing on top of the Ka’bah and saying, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.
And as he gets to the name of Muhammad , he breaks down crying.
I didn't mention his name when I did the lecture on the coronavirus and the plague that killed the companions.
And there is another narration from Abdullah Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and his father who , “Glad tidings of Bilal.” And he , “For what ya Aba Abdillah?” He , “I heard the messenger of Allah   that Bilal will come on the day of judgment holding a standard and all the mu'adhins will follow Bilal until they enter Jannah.” That's a narration that Suyuti considers authentic.
Abdullah Ibn Umar, whose father taught him that Bilal is our master who was freed by our master.
Abdullah Ibn Umar named his son Bilal, after the Bilal.
And of course, Bilal is frequently named in our ummah.
And we have his name, we have his legacy, we have his memory.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
And his entire life story, or much of his life story, is related to his accepting Islam.
He is well known for his struggle, especially as he initially embraced Islam.
that's one element that reflects the early downtrodden ones who accepted Islam and struggled alongside the Prophet , to whom this message resonated.
Imam Muslim has the virtues of Salman, Bilal, and Suhayb to obviously reflect Salman being the first Persian, Bilal being the first Abyssinian who was enslaved to accept Islam, and Suhayb being the first Roman to accept Islam.
Now Bilal embraces Islam upon hearing of the da'wah of the Prophet  immediately.
And  Bilal embraces Islam.
And all of it comes from obviously the place of certainty and steadfastness that Bilal had when he accepted Islam.
And Umayyah did not accept the name of Abdurrahman.
Many of those who entered Islam knew, they made comments, even though they'd embraced Islam, they made comments.
the Prophet   to Bilal, “Tell me what is the most hopeful act that you have done with Allah  since your acceptance of Islam?

--- Persecution ---
And, , it's mentioned in some of the, in the accounts that Bilal, who loved his mother, used to witness his mother being beaten.
he wasn't amongst those who would be beaten frequently.
And not only would they deprive him of water, but out of cruelty, they would drip some drops of water on his chest to mentally torture him further.
This torture will end.
Umayyah did not anticipate the resilience of Bilal in the face of this humiliation, in the face of this torture.
And  when that did not work, when the dehydration did not work and the torture did not work, the next level of cruelty was to take Bilal to the hoodlums of Ta'if.
Torture him, beat him, insult him, assault him in every way possible to break his spirit.
But in any case, , this torture went on for a long time.
And Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud  that when they were put in the iron chains and tortured most severely, the only one who would never show his pain was Bilal.
And  as the torture goes on for weeks and then months, Abu Bakr constantly pushes Umayyah to free Bilal or to sell him Bilal.
And Umayyah wants to win this bout of torture.
Finally, Umayyah tries to torture Bilal in the most severe way, which is that he has Bilal tied to the hot surface in the desert.
I've tried every mechanism of torture and Umayyah is a man driven by money, ?
And Bilal hears obviously that last word of humiliation from the man that has tortured him for all of these years.
He says to Bilal, why is it that when you were being tortured, and he refers to him as our master who was freed by our master.
He says, “How come when you were being tortured, all you  was Ahadun Ahad, one, one?” , Bilal’s response was, “If I knew anything about Allah other than one, one, then I would have  it.” How simple the word, La ilaha illallah encapsulated in Ahadun Ahad, and Bilal does not know any other names of Allah, he doesn't call upon Allah with any du'a book, he doesn't have the names of Allah memorized.
No, Bilal deserves to be the one to chant the adhan, to  la ilaha illallah, standing atop the masjid, because Bilal was the one who was saying la ilaha illallah under that rock and under the most brutal forms of torture.
Now with all these people, especially those that were enslaved and tortured, we talk about Badr, ?
And his master Umayyah or his previous master, of course, who tortured him and oppressed him, Umayyah ibn Khalaf.

--- Hijra ---
No sentences matched this topic.

--- Battle ---
There's a narration about Waraqa ibn Nawfal passing by him.
And of course, as we mentioned in the story of Waraqa, that it does not add up from a timeline perspective that he  to Umayyah that, Wallahi, if you kill him, then I will build a shrine for him.
Of course, I've done other lectures on Bilal where you can find some of these things elaborated on further, but suffice it to  that Bilal would witness every battle and every journey of the Prophet  with the Prophet .
Bilal, before every adhan, would seek permission from the Prophet  to call the adhan.
He thrived off of his lineage and off of his access to power, but Umayyah was not one who  liked to be in battle or to be in confrontation.
And  Umayyah  tried to find many loopholes to get out of this, to get out of the battle of Badr, but had to go out as Abu Jahl had shamed him.
Umayyah ibn Khalaf shows up at the Battle of Badr, and we've talked about what happened to Abu Jahl, and we talked about the vengeance, or what happened with Ammar and Khabbab on the Day of Badr, and  many different people seeing their oppressors fall on the Day of Badr.
When Umayyah showed up to the Battle of Badr, he immediately tried to figure out how to get himself out of a direct confrontation.
And he told Abdurrahman that he'll ransom himself with the most expensive of property to get himself out of being killed or being in that fight.
in regard to Umayyah ibn Khalaf, this is no longer in the battle.
This is after the battle has already ceased.
He says, I literally had to protect Umayyah while Bilal and some of the Ansar were poking with their swords around me, trying to get past me to hit him.
And Abdurrahman ibn Auf says, my foot was  injured because of one of the swords going through, trying to get at Umayyah and going past and hitting my foot.
As for the brother of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Ubayy ibn Khalaf, Ubayy was the first person, the only person killed from the hand of the Prophet  in the battle of Uhud.
In the battles, the various battles between the Muslims and them.
And it was the mercy of Allah  that Allah preserved those early slaves in Mecca to be there on Fath Makkah, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, and not die in the battles that would take place between the original call of Islam and that eventual conquest of Mecca, which represented the great victory of Islam.
And , Bilal, Ammar, and Suhaib, they come across Abu Sufyan, and they , wallahi“Wallahi, the swords of Allah did not reach the enemies of Allah  they should have..”

 you barely escaped, you're lucky we missed you.
You're lucky that the swords of Allah did not reach your throat as they should have.
In fact, he tells Abu Bakr, send me out in battle.
He remembered his warmth, his presence.
And if you have freed me for yourself, then hold me and do with me what you want.” Abu Bakr , “Of course I freed you for Allah, O Bilal.” He says to him, “Go ahead.” And Bilal goes out to Ash-Sham in the process of Jihad, just  many of the companions went out in battle against the Romans at that moment.

--- Virtue(s) ---
Imam Muslim has the virtues of Salman, Bilal, and Suhayb to obviously reflect Salman being the first Persian, Bilal being the first Abyssinian who was enslaved to accept Islam, and Suhayb being the first Roman to accept Islam.
And  Bilal is a special man from the companions of the Prophet , whose honor, even if relegated to one area, lives in the ummah today.
However, as we mentioned the narration last week, Bilal is considered amongst the first seven that publicly expressed their Islam.
However, Tawheed was the first  that Bilal found that resonated with him, ahadun ahad.
And it would infuriate Umayyah because Umayyah felt  he was being generous to Bilal by giving him an easy way out.
One that values him solely on that basis and that extols his virtue because of that and nothing else.
As time goes on, , and there's  much to talk about in regard to the virtues of Bilal and I will try my best to get through at least enough of them.
And that is also important to the context of the adhan of Bilal being the first mu'adhin.
It was the iman, the faith, and the certainty of Bilal that gained him the honor to  la ilaha illallah.
And he's also the first treasurer of the Prophet , the one who would maintain the charity and the wealth as it came into the messenger of Allah .
Bilal is the first in many different ways, ?
There are many ways to attribute the first to Bilal.
As for the brother of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Ubayy ibn Khalaf, Ubayy was the first person, the only person killed from the hand of the Prophet  in the battle of Uhud.
And Bilal stands up on the Ka’bah, the only man to do , think of the scene, the first and only man to do , calling out Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.
The first man to call the Adhan in Medina and then in Mecca, will now be the first man to call the Adhan in Al-Quds, making him the first mu'adhin in all three of the holiest places in Islam.
And I'll just end with these few narrations of the virtues of Bilal and there's  many.

--- Death ---
He may have become a shaheed, a martyr, just  Sumayya.
And  you can imagine then what the death of the Prophet  will do to him, ?
And  that gives some context and I'm jumping a bit because we haven't got to that point of what the death of the Prophet  will do to Bilal.
And he told Abdurrahman that he'll ransom himself with the most expensive of property to get himself out of being killed or being in that fight.
Either I die or he dies.
And Bilal killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf that day and took his revenge that day for what was done to him.
As for the brother of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Ubayy ibn Khalaf, Ubayy was the first person, the only person killed from the hand of the Prophet  in the battle of Uhud.
In the same place that Bilal was placed under a stone and almost killed, saying, Ahadun Ahad, now Bilal is rising up above the Ka’bah to call out Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.
If he dies or if he is killed, will you go back to on your heels?
And  Bilal stands up after the death of the Prophet  and he starts to call the Adhan.
I didn't mention his name when I did the lecture on the coronavirus and the plague that killed the companions.
But Amwas, many of the books  mentioned that this is when Bilal passed away in Ash-Sham due to the plague of Amwas in the year 639, where 25,000 people died, including the likes of Mu'adh ibn Jabal and  many of the great companions of the Prophet .
Here is Bilal now, on his deathbed and his wife, as she sees Bilal leaving this world, and Bilal once saw the Prophet  leaving this world and , what a day of grief.
And he passed away joining the Prophet  and the companions in that high level.
And the only reason we don't have more hadith from him is because of the age at which he died, and the distance that he kept away from the city of Medina after the death of the Prophet .
