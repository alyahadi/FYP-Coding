--- Lineage Overview ---
As we mentioned, when he became Muslim, his mother argued with him.
His mother did not  that, and Zubayr  was going to be tortured by the same uncle who told Safiyyah that she was too rough on him before.
And this uncle was Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, and I believe it was a few years ago that I  gave a khutbah about him because he was a fascinating character to me.
Can you imagine how hurtful it was to the Prophet  that the love of his life, Khadija , that her brother was one of his fiercest enemies.
You don't hear the Prophet  talk much about him but he was  fierce in his persecution of the Prophet  and the things that he would  to the Prophet  and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet  that the Prophet  nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh.
And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet  who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet .
He hated that the brother of Khadija would be such a fierce enemy to him because of how much he loved Khadija .
Zubayr  was going to be tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid which was known at the time especially with the early converts before the open persecution of people that people would be tortured by their own families.
He's the first cousin of the Prophet  because of his mother, Safiyyah, and of course his father was the brother of Khadijah .
When Zubayr embraced Islam, he lost all of his friends with the exception of Talha and Ali, as well, who were close to his age and also his first cousin because of Abu Talib.
He already had the issue of having to overcome the barrier of being an orphan in society and a society that mistreated orphans and as we mentioned, his mother used to beat him and used to discipline him severely before Islam.
After Islam, now his uncle comes and beats him and this is a man that was called the Shaytan of Quraish for a reason.
He would scream out and says, “I will never renounce Islam.” I will never disbelieve, and he'd keep on shouting that out as his uncle would light the fire next to his face, which were obviously burned, but suffocate him until he would pass out and the people would walk by the home and they would hear the screaming of Zubayr .
the courage that his mother wanted him to have, the falcon that she wanted him to be, Zubayr  was all that and more and insisting on his place.
he's inseparable from Talha, even in their names, Talha and Az-Zubayr and Ali  as well in the age and in the closeness that they have.
But as his persecution increases, his personal persecution at the hands of his uncle, who was the shaytan of Quraysh, Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, the Prophet  gives him permission to migrate to Abyssinia, with his cousin Ja'far .
Ja'far is also his first cousin, again because of his mother Safiyyah ibn Abdul Muttalib.
Zubayr  established a close relationship to Hamza, of course, his uncle.
If he was that beloved to his mother, Safiyya, then obviously you can imagine the relationship between Zubayr and Hamza, and they have that same warrior type of personality.
He had a deep relationship with his cousin Ali , and he also had a deep connection to his cousin Ja'far  in Abyssinia, but the physical being of Zubayr, what would Zubayr  look  if you saw him.
Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr, what an amazing human being and what an amazing lineage.
He is the son of Az-Zubayr, the grandson of Abu Bakr, the second cousin of the Prophet .
He has a great lineage that comes through these two of Az-Zubayr and Asma’.
When he was born, the Prophet  himself took his saliva and he did the tahniq, he mixed the saliva in the mouth of Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr , and he made dua and they carried Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr  in the streets of Medina and they chanted behind him shouting Allahu Akbar.
Talha used to name his children after prophets and that's why Talha is Abu Muhammad.
He's the father of Muhammad; he named his first child after Muhammad .
Az-Zubayr on the other hand would name his children after warriors.
Abdullah is Abdullah ibn Jahsh, Mundhir, Mundhir ibn Amr, Urwa, the very famous Urwa ibn Az-Zubayr, who gives us  much of the seerah, is just such a crucial link in the seerah, is named after Urwa ibn Mas'ud.
He had Hamza, of course Hamza Sayyid al-Shuhada, and the beloved uncle and brother of his mother.
Ja'far, he named one of his children Ja'far, he named one of his children Mus'ab, Ubaid ibn al-Harith, Khalid, Umar, these are the names of the children of Az-Zubayr .
This is one of those families where you see that they name their children in a very unique and a very special way.
Urwa ibn Az-Zubayr  says that as a child, I used to  there were three holes in my father's body, his whole body was covered in wounds, but there were three wounds that were  severe I could put my fingers in them, and  it was holes in his body.
he did what would earn him that honour by responding immediately when the Prophet  called out and  who will answer my call, then another one comes forward, and that is that.
On the other side, there was a man by the name of Talha ibn Abi Talha al-Adri, and he was a huge man from Quraysh, and he also had the best horse of the Mushrikeen,  he is coming forward and he is challenging the Muslims, and he is the best horseman.
His cousin, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, the brother of Zainab ibn Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with them was also killed and that's very hurtful to Az-Zubayr  as well, because of how much he loves him and Az-Zubayr  was wounded heavily that day and he's one of the few people that did not flee from the Prophet  on the day of Uhud.
Aisha , she told Urwa ibn Az-Zubayr, do  the verse that was revealed about your father and your grandfather, who is his father Az-Zubayr, who is his grandfather Abu Bakr As-Siddiq ?
Remember, these people have an incredible lineage in that sense.
Az-Zubayr is your father, Asma’ is your mother, Abu Bakr is your grandfather.
Aisha who is the aunt of Urwa says to Urwa, “Do  what verse was revealed about your father and your grandfather?
And Aisha  told Urwa, this is about your father and your grandfather and those that were with them, those that stuck around with the Prophet  when others had fled at that point, those that were willing to die at that moment around the Prophet .
How much more honoured can you be in the battle of Khandaq, as the Prophet  got news of those that were plotting on the inside from Banu Qurayza and other tribes.
And I want us to seize this point for a moment because it's often just brushed over as one of the virtues of Az-Zubayr , the Prophet  called him his disciple, likened him to the disciples of Isa AS, al hawariyun, and I want us to  sit with this for a moment.
What is the significance of the Prophet  calling him with that specific name of being his disciple, when the hawariyun are mentioned in the Quran, when the disciples of Isa AS are mentioned in the Quran.
When the Prophet   to Zubayr, I would sacrifice my mother and my father for you.
You find Az-Zubayr  after the Prophet  fighting in the battle against the apostates under the khilafah of his father-in-law, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq .
Az-Zubayr  cast his vote for Ali ibn Abi Talib , who of course was his cousin and very close to him and Zubayr knew his station with the prophet .
And sitting together as brothers, , they loved each other, they grew up together, they embraced Islam together, they were the same age, they had a history.
He says, “Remember the prophet  saw us sitting together and we were sitting together as brothers and the prophet   to you, “Oh Zubayr, do you love Ali ?” And Zubayr , “Of course, wallahi I love Ali, ya Rasulullah.” And the prophet   that “You will fight against him, and you will be in the wrong.” And to Zubayr , that was impossible I’m gonna fight against Ali ,  how could that happen.
this is the tragedy and his name was Amr ibn Jarmuz.
he called me and he stood beside me and he , “Oh my son, listen, today someone's going to, , a person is going to be killed either as an oppressor or an oppressed one.
he told his son, seek the help of my lord and Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr  says for four years, I would stand up in hajj and I'd call out and I  if anyone has a debt from my father, let me know.
To that by the time, and again it's about a two-page hadith, by the time each one of these people gave back the loans that were owed to Az-Zubayr, to his family, Az-Zubayr 's property was valued at over 50 million dinars.
And he recited that, “We have taken the grudges anything from their hearts and made them brothers facing one another on thrones.
Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr  says I  to my father, “I don't hear from you the narrations of Allah's messenger the way that I hear from this person and that person.” And Az-Zubayr  , “I was always with him.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
They  that he embraced Islam  away with Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  and he is inseparable from Talha ibn Ubaidullah , who we'll talk about after Asma .
And the youth, they're only 12 or 13 years old each as they're coming to embrace Islam, and they listen to the da'wah of Abu Bakr, and immediately they're convinced.
When Zubayr embraced Islam, he lost all of his friends with the exception of Talha and Ali, as well, who were close to his age and also his first cousin because of Abu Talib.
And sitting together as brothers, , they loved each other, they grew up together, they embraced Islam together, they were the same age, they had a history.

--- Persecution ---
His mother did not  that, and Zubayr  was going to be tortured by the same uncle who told Safiyyah that she was too rough on him before.
You don't hear the Prophet  talk much about him but he was  fierce in his persecution of the Prophet  and the things that he would  to the Prophet  and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet  that the Prophet  nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh.
Zubayr  was going to be tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid which was known at the time especially with the early converts before the open persecution of people that people would be tortured by their own families.
He already had the issue of having to overcome the barrier of being an orphan in society and a society that mistreated orphans and as we mentioned, his mother used to beat him and used to discipline him severely before Islam.
After Islam, now his uncle comes and beats him and this is a man that was called the Shaytan of Quraish for a reason.
His beating of Zubayr was  severe and it was very cruel.
He would wrap Zubayr  up in a rug and he put him in a small room and then he would light a fire next to his face and the smoke of that fire would suffocate Zubayr  and he would step on him and beat him and tell him to renounce Islam.
But it wasn't the screaming of torture, it was the screaming of resistance.
he goes from his torture and you would think that some of that torture would shake him up a bit, that would deter him a bit.
He would always be amongst the people of Dar al-Arqam, listening to the Quran as it came down, accompanying the Prophet , despite whatever torture he would have to face.
Now notice that he's being tortured  the others are being tortured.
And to this point, especially in the early days, the Prophet  himself was not facing physical persecution.
But the Prophet  was sitting one day and as he is sitting, Zubayr , this young man who is facing the torture of his life comes running towards the Prophet  breathing heavily and he's holding his sword.
That's what I was going to do.”  the Prophet  was impressed by the courage of Zubayr that he wasn't thinking about his own persecution.
that's why Zubayr  earns that noble title of being the first one to draw his sword in defence of the Prophet  in Mecca as the persecution would start to grow of our messenger .
he is facing his own persecution.
But as his persecution increases, his personal persecution at the hands of his uncle, who was the shaytan of Quraysh, Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, the Prophet  gives him permission to migrate to Abyssinia, with his cousin Ja'far .

--- Hijra ---
he came back to Mecca prior to the migration to Medina and he marries Asma’, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr  wanted his daughters to be married to those who were struggling in the path of Allah .
Asma’  made the hijrah while she was very late in her pregnancy, and obviously Asma’ played a role in the hijrah of the Prophet , which we'll talk about.
She was not just tasked with traveling from Mecca to Medina, but she also plays a role in assisting the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  in the migration of the Prophet , all while she was very pregnant.
Asma’ and Zubayr arrive in Medina, and obviously when you read about the hijrah to Medina and you read about the way that the Muslims who came from Mecca felt, they felt  Medina was death.
One of them of course being the change of environment, the difficulties of the hijrah, and just the rate of fatalities at birth at the time, but Asma’  and Az-Zubayr would be the first to have a child that gave birth to none other than Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr .

--- Battle ---
And it was deeply hurtful to the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah  did not want to come face to face with him in the battle of Badr.
But the Prophet  was sitting one day and as he is sitting, Zubayr , this young man who is facing the torture of his life comes running towards the Prophet  breathing heavily and he's holding his sword.
And he arrives at the Prophet  panting, holding his sword and then he catches his breath, and the Prophet  says, “What's wrong with you?
What's happening here?” He , “Ya Rasulullah, I was told that you were attacked.”  Rasulullah , he smiled at Zubayr , and he , “What were you going to do if I was attacked?” “I was going to hit whoever attacked you with this sword.
that's why Zubayr  earns that noble title of being the first one to draw his sword in defence of the Prophet  in Mecca as the persecution would start to grow of our messenger .
But as his persecution increases, his personal persecution at the hands of his uncle, who was the shaytan of Quraysh, Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, the Prophet  gives him permission to migrate to Abyssinia, with his cousin Ja'far .
That they met at the Nile River for a battle and obviously the Muslims had to stay out of it and Najashi had privately given to Ja'far and Uthman and the Muslims a ship, and given them a contingency plan in case he himself was going to be killed.
But they made something for him  a little skin for him to be able to go in the Nile itself and to check on the battle and then to come back and to report to the Muslims what was happening.
He goes to where the battle is taking place and then he comes back, and as they see Zubayr  swimming in the Nile to come back, and they're waiting for the news Az-Zubayr  chants.
that wAz-Zubayr  who courageously went through the Nile to check up on the two battles or the battles between the two armies, one of course the army of the righteous Najashi .
If he was that beloved to his mother, Safiyya, then obviously you can imagine the relationship between Zubayr and Hamza, and they have that same warrior type of personality.
It's mentioned that he had a light beard,  he didn't have a full beard but he's mentioned as being extremely tall, and lean, and muscular, and it's  about him that he was similar in his height to Umar bin Khattab , and that when he sat on an animal, his feet would almost touch the ground from his horse because of how tall he was.
he had a prominent height, and he was extremely lean and muscular, and as we've seen here, could do things that others could not do and that would obviously play out in many ways in battle.
Zubayr  is one of those companions of the Prophet  whose legacy is almost entirely tied to his actions in battle alongside the Prophet  and in taking on assignments that other people were not willing to take on.
Asma’ knows what type of marriage she's getting into in the sense of his struggle, his lifestyle, the riskiness of being married to a person  Zubayr , who's never just an average person in the battle, but who's always out front and who lives a very difficult lifestyle.
Az-Zubayr  would go on to have numerous children with Asma’ and afterwards he would get married multiple times.
Az-Zubayr on the other hand would name his children after warriors.
And Az-Zubayr , as we , is someone whose legacy is prominent in the battlefield.
he  he was tall, he was built, he was  the height of Umar al-Khattab, his feet would touch the ground when he rides his horse.
He also had the unique ability, being the only other person than Khalid who could control his horse with his legs and could carry two swords at the same time.
you can imagine in battle, the ability as a horseman to be able to have  much strength in your legs, to be able to guide the horse and direct the legs and have  much strength in both of your arms to wield two swords in the middle of battle and to  fight that way.
And we know about his legacy in the battlefield  that should give you an image of Az-Zubayr , that he could ride in the battlefield with both of his swords, and he was extremely productive in battle, guiding his horse with only his legs.
every single battle that Az-Zubayr fights in is a day for Az-Zubayr and none more special than the battle of Badr.
just  the veterans of Badr are the best of the companions, the veterans of Badr from the angels are considered the best of the angels, and Jibreel AS of course came forth at the order of Allah  with his army of angels on that day of the battle of Badr.
Az-Zubayr  was one of only two horsemen that day, if you remember the Muslims were caught off guard in Badr, they were not ready for a full out battle.
not only were they outnumbered, they were out armoured, they didn't have horses either.
They only had two horses, whereas  the other side had a hundred horses, a thousand people.
They were fully armed, and they had extra horses on demand when needed.
The Muslims had two who rode those horses, Miqdad and Az-Zubayr.
two amongst 315 Muslims had horses, one of them was Az-Zubayr .
He wore this yellow turban for the day of that battle, and he would penetrate into the army of the mushrikeen and he would fight off all of the horsemen, taking his two swords.
He would run between the horsemen and he would wield both of his swords and he would knock people off of their swords  and left in the battle of Badr, and he would suffer two serious wounds in the battle of Badr, which we'll talk about and that didn't slow him down at all.
He  two of them were from Badr, and one of them from the famous battle of Yarmouk.
this is Az-Zubayr  going forth on the day of Badr, leading not just the humans but leading the angels as well who were emulating him, including Jibreel AS on that day in the battle of Uhud.
Now Uhud is obviously an even greater disadvantage in the sense that the Muslims are more outnumbered and the army on the other side is bigger and the Prophet  says, “Who will take my sword?” Zubayr  immediately says, “I will ya Rasulullah.” The Prophet  says again, “Who will take my sword?” and Az-Zubayr  , “I will ya Rasulullah.” And the Prophet  says a third time, “Who will take my sword?” Abu Dujana  , “I will, ya Rasulullah.” And the Prophet  gave it to Abu Dujana , and the Prophet   to take it with its , that this is a heavy burden you're going to carry, the sword of the Prophet .
Az-Zubayr  says, I was hurt in my heart when I saw that the Prophet  chose him instead of me, but then when I saw Abu Dujana  on the battlefield, I understood exactly why the Prophet  chose him.
Abu Dujana played a prominent role in the beginning of the battle and throughout the battle by the side of the Prophet .
he did what would earn him that honour by responding immediately when the Prophet  called out and  who will answer my call, then another one comes forward, and that is that.
On the other side, there was a man by the name of Talha ibn Abi Talha al-Adri, and he was a huge man from Quraysh, and he also had the best horse of the Mushrikeen,  he is coming forward and he is challenging the Muslims, and he is the best horseman.
He has the best horse amongst the Mushrikeen, and that is saying a lot, considering the worth and the value of horses at that time.
He is that person that you are looking on the other side of the battlefield, and you are thinking you are going to have to have a few people that are going to take him out.
He is not an easy person to fight.
He is someone who is boastful and arrogant, that has a reputation,  he comes out on the best horse and he calls out and says, “Who is going to come forth and duel with me?” The only person that answers the call is Az-Zubayr  and the Prophet  lets Az-Zubayr go.
When Az-Zubayr goes forward, Safiya comes to the Prophet  and she says, “Ya Rasulullah he is going to kill my son.”  that is not easy, even if you think about the strength and the size.
He has the best horse on the other side, he is more equipped than Az-Zubayr.
he combined the best attributes of a tiger and a lion in battle.
Az-Zubayr  goes up to him, and Talha bin Abi Talha is stunned that Az-Zubayr is standing on the ground and ready to fight him.
he doesn't even have a horse that's going to go at it with him and  they start to duel.
Within minutes, Az-Zubayr  walked up to him, he knocked his sword down and then he attacks him, he knocks him off of his horse, he grabs the sword of Talha bin Abi Talha, he climbs up his horse and then he kills him with his sword and then he brings the horse back to the Muslims.
You don't get any more courageous than this, alright  this man, who no one wanted a piece of, who has the best horse on the other side,  the best case scenario is that you get the horse too you get the armor, too but  you just want to take him out.
Az-Zubayr  kills him, brings the horse back, and now the best horse on the battlefield that day was going to be on the side of the Muslims.
that's when Az-Zubayr  once again showed something about himself that was  unique about his courage and about his ability to move forward.
And it was the verse those that responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger .” After that horrendous defeat, after the horrific thing that had happened to them in the battle of Uhud, those that stayed around, those that did not flee, Allah  praised them and Allah elevated them.
in the battle of Uhud, once again you have Az-Zubayr , not fleeing by the side of the Prophet  throughout and doing as the Prophet  commands him.
How much more honoured can you be in the battle of Khandaq, as the Prophet  got news of those that were plotting on the inside from Banu Qurayza and other tribes.
And I want us to seize this point for a moment because it's often just brushed over as one of the virtues of Az-Zubayr , the Prophet  called him his disciple, likened him to the disciples of Isa AS, al hawariyun, and I want us to  sit with this for a moment.
What is the significance of the Prophet  calling him with that specific name of being his disciple, when the hawariyun are mentioned in the Quran, when the disciples of Isa AS are mentioned in the Quran.
Who will support me in this noble mission?
Jesus, peace be upon him, speaking and saying ‘Who's going to come to my aid?’ The hawariyun are praised, they come forth and  we will be the helpers of Allah .
Of course there's a specific disciple that would  volunteer himself to take the image of Isa AS and to even be crucified in his place,  the hawariyun are praised particularly for the quickness of the response, and what do you keep on seeing with az-Zubayr  responds immediately.
Throughout the other battles, you find that Malik ibn U'uf, surrenders in Hunain when he sees that Zubayr is still up.
You find Az-Zubayr  after the Prophet  fighting in the battle against the apostates under the khilafah of his father-in-law, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq .
You find in the battle of Yarmouk, remember, Urwa mentioned specifically the two wounds of Badr, and then he mentioned a wound in the battle of Yarmouk.
Yarmouk was a difficult battle for the Muslims against the Byzantines at the time and Az-Zubayr  led the charge, and one of the things that Zubayr  did on the battle of Yarmouk was that he climbed the wall of the fortress on the day of the battle of Yarmouk.
And he mounted forward, going forth through the Roman army, and this is how Az-Zubayr  has described, he drove through the entire army himself, penetrating, and he was able to defeat everyone in his path.
Before the battle even started to its full,  he went into the army and penetrated all the way to the back taking out everyone on the way, and then took everyone out on the way back, making his way back to the front lines and that was the bravery, the courage, the skill of Zubayr .
You give me one Az-Zubayr  is  having a thousand men due to his bravery and the way that he moved forward.
Az-Zubayr  wanted to kill them all, he wanted to fight off all of those people, and Uthman  continued to  no, you can't fight for me, don't do it.
Az-Zubayr sends his children to guard Uthman , but he's frustrated at not being able to fight those people that had held Uthman under siege.
They come forth and they meet Ali ibn Abi Talib  before the battle of Al-Jamal, and this is a very tragic conversation and way that he's going to die, but in brief, we know that Aisha  and Ali  would talk, they would come to terms, they would go back to their camps and the idea was that there was going to be no battle, that they came to an agreement, that Ali was going to pursue the killers of Uthman, and that things were going to move forward.
The people of fitna attacked both sides at night, both camps,  that each one of them thought that the other side struck first, and then the battle of Al-Jamal takes place.
He says, “Remember the prophet  saw us sitting together and we were sitting together as brothers and the prophet   to you, “Oh Zubayr, do you love Ali ?” And Zubayr , “Of course, wallahi I love Ali, ya Rasulullah.” And the prophet   that “You will fight against him, and you will be in the wrong.” And to Zubayr , that was impossible I’m gonna fight against Ali ,  how could that happen.
He  gave his bay'ah to Ali ,  he gave his pledge to Ali, and he left the battlefield.
He walked away from the battlefield.
before at night again, the two camps go and a battle breaks out the next day because each one thinks they've been attacked.
Az-Zubayr has already walked away from the battlefield, ‘I'm not doing this ’ he realizes that this was a fitna that was caused, and he remembered that incident with the prophet .
Az-Zubayr is walking away, people are following him and they're saying what's wrong and he's saying leave me alone, I'm done, I'm not fighting, I have nothing to do with any of this battle.
One of the Khawarij, he follows Az-Zubayr .
Zubayr  says fine, if it's because you're walking away from this battle just  me, that's fine.
When the time for salah came, it's just Zubayr and this man, he doesn't know that  I just want to be your companion and if they fight, Zubayr is going to overpower him.
Az-Zubayr  stands up, Amr ibn Jarmuz makes the iqama for salah, Zubayr  says allahu akbar to lead the salah, and Amr attacks him and starts to stab him until he kills him and he took the sword of Zubayr .
The man kills Zubayr , takes his sword, and he goes to the tent of Ali .
Ali  is sitting in his tent and  this man is approaching with the sword of Zubayr, he says I want to talk to Ali.
this man, Amr bin Jarmuz thinks that Ali is going to celebrate the death of Zubayr, he gives the sword to the guard and he says go show him the sword.
the man walks and he waits outside to hear the reaction of Ali , thinking Ali is going to be happy to hear the murder of Zubayr, because that's what's going to be shown here, that he had come to fight you.
Ali  is sitting in his tent and the sword of Zubayr  comes in front of him and Ali  starts to cry and he starts to weep loudly and Ali  , I heard the prophet  , “When you meet the murderer of Ibn Safiyya, when you see the person who kills Zubayr, tell him he's a person of hellfire.”  Ali had heard this hadith from the prophet , he give the news to the one who murders Ibn Safiyya, Zubayr , that he's a person of hellfire.
Ali had heard it, not realizing that he's going to be sitting in the tent the day that the sword of Zubayr comes to him.
That is us sitting on that day facing one another on thrones.” That the fitna had caused companions to find themselves on opposite ends of the battlefield, and Ali  was pained over that way, and the nastiness of the way that Az-Zubayr  was killed.
JazakumAllahu khayran wasalamualikoum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh

--- Virtue(s) ---
The type of strength that she was imparting upon Zubayr  and hoping that he would grow up with, and of course he would grow up with that strength and exceed all of the expectations of that strength and that courage and that intelligence and that nobility and that honour.
And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet  who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet .
He's the first cousin of the Prophet  because of his mother, Safiyyah, and of course his father was the brother of Khadijah .
the courage that his mother wanted him to have, the falcon that she wanted him to be, Zubayr  was all that and more and insisting on his place.
That's what I was going to do.”  the Prophet  was impressed by the courage of Zubayr that he wasn't thinking about his own persecution.
that's why Zubayr  earns that noble title of being the first one to draw his sword in defence of the Prophet  in Mecca as the persecution would start to grow of our messenger .
that wAz-Zubayr  who courageously went through the Nile to check up on the two battles or the battles between the two armies, one of course the army of the righteous Najashi .
You can imagine how much courage was in that household of Asma’ and Zubayr and Safiyyah all together, not to then mention the children that would come after them.
They're going to have miscarriages, and for the first couple of months, no one  had a child.
One of them of course being the change of environment, the difficulties of the hijrah, and just the rate of fatalities at birth at the time, but Asma’  and Az-Zubayr would be the first to have a child that gave birth to none other than Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr .
You don't get any more courageous than this, alright  this man, who no one wanted a piece of, who has the best horse on the other side,  the best case scenario is that you get the horse too you get the armor, too but  you just want to take him out.
that's when Az-Zubayr  once again showed something about himself that was  unique about his courage and about his ability to move forward.
And I want us to seize this point for a moment because it's often just brushed over as one of the virtues of Az-Zubayr , the Prophet  called him his disciple, likened him to the disciples of Isa AS, al hawariyun, and I want us to  sit with this for a moment.
the specific virtue of the disciples in the Quran is their response to the call to support the Prophet.
Before the battle even started to its full,  he went into the army and penetrated all the way to the back taking out everyone on the way, and then took everyone out on the way back, making his way back to the front lines and that was the bravery, the courage, the skill of Zubayr .
You give me one Az-Zubayr  is  having a thousand men due to his bravery and the way that he moved forward.

--- Death ---
He heard that the Prophet  was attacked, and he went forth to defend the Prophet   away, not thinking about the consequences of which would have surely been that he would be killed.
That they met at the Nile River for a battle and obviously the Muslims had to stay out of it and Najashi had privately given to Ja'far and Uthman and the Muslims a ship, and given them a contingency plan in case he himself was going to be killed.
Asma’ and Zubayr arrive in Medina, and obviously when you read about the hijrah to Medina and you read about the way that the Muslims who came from Mecca felt, they felt  Medina was death.
Now on that day of course we mentioned  with Safiyyah and Hamza  that day, and honestly a very hard biography to cover because of how much I love Hamza , but it hurt him that obviously Hamza  was killed.
His cousin, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, the brother of Zainab ibn Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with them was also killed and that's very hurtful to Az-Zubayr  as well, because of how much he loves him and Az-Zubayr  was wounded heavily that day and he's one of the few people that did not flee from the Prophet  on the day of Uhud.
Those that at the time when it looked  it was all over, the Prophet  was to be killed, literally put their bodies in front of the Prophet  and suffered all sorts of wounds on that day.
After Umar bin Khattab  passed away, Az-Zubayr of course being one of the remaining 10 promised paradise was chosen to be on the shura of Umar bin Khattab , and Az-Zubayr  of course the shura came together and they chose they cast their vote.
And I have to mention his death because one of the most tragic deaths that we have and in fact that is the case not just with him, but with his son.
How is it that a person  incredible,  amazing, would be killed in the fitan from the inside, not taken out from an enemy on the outside, but on the fitan from the inside.
And by the way this is something about the death of Zubayr in his salah.
this man, Amr bin Jarmuz thinks that Ali is going to celebrate the death of Zubayr, he gives the sword to the guard and he says go show him the sword.
I killed him instead.
he murdered Zubayr  and then he killed himself.
And  Zubayr , this noble man, who used to make dua to Allah to die in his salah, and his children die in their salah, all of them are given this noble death.
One of them is from Abdullah ibn Zubayr , he  that Az-Zubayr came to me on the day of his death before he would die, and he just saw the scene and he could smell death in the air, he knew something was going to happen.
he called me and he stood beside me and he , “Oh my son, listen, today someone's going to, , a person is going to be killed either as an oppressor or an oppressed one.
I think I'm going to die today as an oppressed one.” I don't know why but sensing death and this is something with the salihin that sometimes you see that they sense death,  he's telling his son, Abdullah, that listen I'm sensing death.
My biggest worry is my debts, and this man's about to go as a shaheed.
I'm about to be killed as an oppressed one.
That is us sitting on that day facing one another on thrones.” That the fitna had caused companions to find themselves on opposite ends of the battlefield, and Ali  was pained over that way, and the nastiness of the way that Az-Zubayr  was killed.
