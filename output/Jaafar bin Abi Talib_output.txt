--- Lineage Overview ---
Amongst his names, he's known as Abu Abdillah because of his son Abdullah and Dhul Janahain, the one with two wings which obviously has a beautiful story to it that we will talk about.
Now a lot of the family history of Banu Hashim we covered when we talked about Ali and Fatima, may Allah be pleased with them, but I want to talk about just a little bit once again about the way that Ja'far  comes into the picture and reminds everyone who his mother is.
We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam.
The first woman from the tribe of Banu Hashim to accept Islam and some  the 10th or the 11th person to accept Islam.
amongst the children of Abu Talib and the cousins of the Prophet , no one looked more  the Prophet  than Ja'far .
And if you remember the names, the way that these names are chosen, and the children of Abu Talib all had something to live up to.
And you look at Abu Talib and how he named his four sons.
And we can see, the way that these names would play out.
Al-Abbas, who is the brother of Abu Talib, the uncle of the Prophet , comes to the Prophet  and he says that Abu Talib is going through some difficult times, that he is suffering from poverty.
And as we , it is the divine planning of Allah  that Ali was not officially adopted, which of course, tabanni was a practice in jahliyyah, which was to fully take on the name of the person that adopts you.
And this is something that we'll see the deep love that the Prophet  has for Ja'far, which also gives us this idea of silaturrahim, to enjoy good family relations beyond just the siblings, beyond just your own children and your aunts and your uncles.
But here, you see the importance of having these strong relationships with our cousins, with our family members in the extended sense.
And if Ali  embraced Islam that early, and then Fatima bint Asad embraced Islam that early, Ja'far is amongst those who embraced Islam very early on with his cousin, the Prophet .
If you remember the story of Lubaba, when we talked about the believing sisters, as we talked about Lubaba bint al-Harith .
Asma’ bint Umais is one of the believing sisters, the early Muslim women that would dedicate themselves to this cause, that would give themselves to the cause of Allah  and the messenger of Allah .
Now, we don't have much about their life before the migration to Abyssinia, but we do know that they were amongst the family of the Prophet  and they were in that situation, subjected to similar persecution.
These people include the closest family members of the Prophet  and some of the best of people.
And Amr ibn Aas has a relationship with Najashi through his father, Al-Aas, that precedes Islam.
We remained in this state until Allah sent us a prophet, one of our own, whose lineage, truthfulness, trustworthiness and integrity were well known to us.
He called us to worship Allah alone and to renounce the stones and the idols, which we and our ancestors used to worship beside Allah.
we left for your land, choosing you before anyone else, desiring your protection and hoping to live in justice and in peace in your midst.”

 Najashi hears these beautiful words and this is the way that Ja'far  really lives up to his name and summarizes Islam in a pretty intimidating setting.
And what you find is that with Ja'far and Asma’, that all three of their sons were born in Abyssinia.
He settled there, he had his family there and now he's with the Prophet .
Ja'far  , look, she's the daughter of my uncle because Hamza is the uncle of Ja'far.
And my wife is her maternal aunt as well, because Asma’ bint Umais is the sister of Salma bint Umais.
Ja'far says Hamza is my uncle and my wife and his wife are sisters.
Ali  , she's the daughter of my uncle.
Because number one, you find the famous hadith where the Prophet  , the maternal aunt is  the mother.
Abu Hurairah  says that we used to call Ja'far  the father of the poor.
That Ja'far  was the father of the poor in that he used to come close to them and he would give everything that he had.
And in this narration, though this narration has a weakness in its chain, in Ibn Majah, that the Prophet  gave him the nickname of the father of the poor.
He had just gotten his cousin back to Medina, his brother back who resembled him most in appearance and character.
That's a major hit to the family of the Prophet , and to the heart of the Prophet .
They spent 12 years in a foreign land together, raised their family as this minority, came to Medina, were now in the presence of the Prophet  and she is witnessing the best of her husband Ja'far .
He is an uncle to them.
This was the way that the Prophet  was as an uncle, as a brother, as a messenger .
And he , he left the home, and this is where we  find the famous narration where the Prophet  , “Make food for the family of Ja'far  because they are busy with the news that has come to them.”  this is where we find the sunnah of taking care of the family when they are dealing with death in the family.
, the sunnah is to prepare food for the family, not to make the family prepare food or be burdened with hosting other people.
We burden the family.
And, we do the complete opposite of the sunnah, but this is where we  find the narration about how to take care of the family of the deceased.
But what comfort does it give to the family of Ja'far  when the Prophet  says that I saw him flying in Jannah along with the angels, and hence the nickname, the two-winged person.
And this is not a nickname that comes later on in Islam.
This is a nickname that the companions knew Ja'far by, the one with two wings because of what the Prophet  , the possessor of two wings.
Some of you might remember, I'd given a talk about my mother, may Allah have mercy on her, May Hashim, almost 10 years ago.
I told her story and her family, she was a descendant of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib , and I grew up with this image on the wall,   next to her bed where everyone from the descendants of Ja'far .
It's not just the way that they trace their lineage back to who it is from Banu Hashim they trace their lineage to, but they  have a unique thing for Ja'far  where they prepare the names on the leather and they trace the lineage back that for their portion of Banu Hashim, they have two wings at the top and growing up it's, I would always look at that on her wall  next to her bed, those two wings of Ja'far  and then the family of Ja'far  descending from that.
As for Asma’ bint Umais, may Allah be pleased with her, when we talk about the way that the companions used to marry the widows, Asma’ bint Umais, you might have heard her name already a few times as we're going through the stories of these people Asma’ bint Umais  after the death of Ja'far was married to none other than Abu Bakr as-Siddiq .
Abu Bakr marries Asma’ and he has his one son in Islam born to Asma’ bint Umais and he is Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.
And Muhammad bin Ja'far and Muhammad bin Abi Bakr get into an argument and Muhammad bin Abi Bakr says to Muhammad bin Ja'far who was older than him, his older half-brother, he says, “I'm better than you, and my father is better than your father.”  he pulled that card.
Abu Bakr and Ja'far and Ali and Asma’ and the children that came from that and the lessons that we take from the treatment of widows, the way the Prophet  consoled that family, the way that the community move forward with that family.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam.
The first woman from the tribe of Banu Hashim to accept Islam and some  the 10th or the 11th person to accept Islam.
Now, if you remember with Fatima bint Asad, when she accepted Islam, she accepted Islam instantly.
anyway, when does Ja'far embrace Islam?
Some of the reports  that he was as early as the 15th or 16th person to accept Islam.
even though we don't have any specific records of the exact time of the conversion of Ja'far , we know that it was very early on, and we know that there was no hesitation.
And if Ali  embraced Islam that early, and then Fatima bint Asad embraced Islam that early, Ja'far is amongst those who embraced Islam very early on with his cousin, the Prophet .
And the dates suggest that it was probably just  we saw with Sa'eed bin Zayd and Fatima bint al-Khattab, Ja'far and his wife Asma’ bint Umais accepting Islam together.
you have Ja'far and Asma’ accepting Islam together.
Or he could have accepted them but rejected their religion, all ?
And that's another story that I don't want to take too much time with, but he could have just , I'm going to give you refuge, but I'm not going to accept your religion.
Or the third one is that he accepts Islam, and he accepts them and gives them refuge in the land of Abyssinia.
He does not accept their religion  away.
At that point, Najashi dismisses everyone from the courts, and he tells Ja'far  that he himself has now embraced Islam, that he has become Muslim.
Ja'far  has successfully given da'wah to the king who has secretly embraced Islam.
He embraced Ja'far and kissed him between his eyes.
He came into Medina as humble as when he embraced Islam and demonstrating that same mercy, that the mercy to the world's Muhammad  was known for.
At that point Khalid ibn al-Walid, who had just accepted Islam.
But then when Ali came, she accepted his proposal, and she married Ali  and she'd even live past Ali and she wouldn't marry after Ali  was martyred.

--- Persecution ---
Now, we don't have much about their life before the migration to Abyssinia, but we do know that they were amongst the family of the Prophet  and they were in that situation, subjected to similar persecution.
And that the persecution became  severe for Ja'far and Asma’, that they sought permission to be amongst those who would go out to Abyssinia.
we're talking about the future batches that would then go to Abyssinia to escape the persecution of Mecca.
But they also know that if they are able to get Najashi to send them back, that will be a crippling blow to the Prophet  and to the early Muslims as they are dealing with that persecution.

--- Hijra ---
And  when you talk about the firsts, Ja'far  is not only one of the first converts, he’s part of the first hijrah to Abyssinia even though he's from the second batch to Abyssinia which is modern day Ethiopia.
And she was amongst those who considered to make hijrah to Abyssinia with her son, Ja'far, and with her daughter-in-law.
Now, we don't have much about their life before the migration to Abyssinia, but we do know that they were amongst the family of the Prophet  and they were in that situation, subjected to similar persecution.
And the list goes on of some of the most noble companions that were in that batch of Abyssinia that would make hijrah to Abyssinia.
Which for the purpose of the hijrah would have been sufficient, ?
, the Prophet  is putting a lot into this migration by the types of people that he is sending, and Quraysh know that the stakes are high as well.
They're not with the Prophet  in Mecca, nor are they with the initial migration to Medina.
,  we're talking about much later in time in Medina, several years after the hijrah.
And what Zayd meant by that is that the Prophet  paired off Zayd and Hamza at the time of the hijrah.
Umar  says to her, that we preceded you in hijrah.
He says that we preceded you to the migration.
For him and his companions have only one hijrah and you are the people of two hijrahs.”  the Prophet  rules in the favour of Asma’, the wife of Ja'far in that sense and says you are the people of two hijrahs.
Hijrah wipes away everything that comes before it.
And these were the people that made the two most noble hijrahs, the hijrah to Abyssinia as well as the hijrah to Medina, all for the sake of Allah .
Ja'far  assumes the command and Ja'far, who had just made the hijrah to Medina to be in the companionship of the Prophet , is experiencing this difficult battle and he fights  bravely.

--- Battle ---
He is among the first Muslims who would be martyred in battle as a commander, which we'll see in the battle of Mu'tah.
And that the persecution became  severe for Ja'far and Asma’, that they sought permission to be amongst those who would go out to Abyssinia.
Ja'far comes forward and at that point, Ja'far  gives probably one of the most eloquent speeches ever about Islam.
And it was  at the time that the Prophet  had won the battle of Khaybar.
And then, it was only a short time after that he's going to take part in his first battle alongside or under the command of the Prophet , and that is the battle of Mu'tah, which is a difficult battle against the Byzantines who had mobilized to attack the Muslims or they had attacked one of the emissaries, one of the ambassadors of the Prophet .
And the Prophet  sends in that battle, it's not that Ja’far had a long time, but Ja’far is distinguished, he sends in that battle the first commander Zayd ibn Haritha, the beloved one of the Prophet .
some of the ulama  that was unique and that was different about this battle.
And it's as if the Prophet  knew, he was giving an indication that this was going to be a difficult battle, a battle that was not  the other battles that they would experience.
And they are more skilled warriors, and this is meant to be a statement sent to the Muslims by the Byzantine empire, ?
they go to fight the Byzantines in this battle in Mu'tah.
Ja'far  assumes the command and Ja'far, who had just made the hijrah to Medina to be in the companionship of the Prophet , is experiencing this difficult battle and he fights  bravely.
He is swinging his sword  and left and he is suffering all sorts of wounds along the way.
He becomes a shaheed, a martyr in the battle of Mu'tah.
It's as if he felt something  about this particular battle.
On top of this Zayd, his son , who in Jahiliyya, who he adopted as a son and his beloved one also was killed in this battle.
Asma’  knows that Ja'far has gone out to battle.
She knows that the army is on its way back from battle.
He saw Waraqa, he saw Zaid ibn Amir as we spoke about, and these were people that he saw in Jannah.
When Fatima  dies, Ali  sometime afterwards then proposes to her and marries her and it  that Asma’ bint Umais, she turned down a ton of proposals.
Abu Bakr and Ja'far and Ali and Asma’ and the children that came from that and the lessons that we take from the treatment of widows, the way the Prophet  consoled that family, the way that the community move forward with that family.
Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.

--- Virtue(s) ---
Everyone, welcome back to the first and inshallah ta'ala tonight we will continue with Ja'far ibn Abi Talib  and his story of Islam.
And  when you talk about the firsts, Ja'far  is not only one of the first converts, he’s part of the first hijrah to Abyssinia even though he's from the second batch to Abyssinia which is modern day Ethiopia.
He's from the first to migrate for the sake of Allah.
He's the first to do da'wah to a king.
He's the first to have a king convert to Islam at his hand.
He is among the first Muslims who would be martyred in battle as a commander, which we'll see in the battle of Mu'tah.
He's the first to recite Quran in the court of a king.
We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam.
The first woman from the tribe of Banu Hashim to accept Islam and some  the 10th or the 11th person to accept Islam.
And he makes mention in the book of Maryam AS, all the way through the virtues of Maryam, through the birth of Isa AS, through Jesus peace be upon him speaking from the cradle.
Notice that it wasn't that Ja'far  was the most generous in the sense that he gave more money than the others.
And the Prophet  sends in that battle, it's not that Ja’far had a long time, but Ja’far is distinguished, he sends in that battle the first commander Zayd ibn Haritha, the beloved one of the Prophet .
He's one of the first people to die.
Ja'far  assumes the command and Ja'far, who had just made the hijrah to Medina to be in the companionship of the Prophet , is experiencing this difficult battle and he fights  bravely.

--- Death ---
He is among the first Muslims who would be martyred in battle as a commander, which we'll see in the battle of Mu'tah.
And if you haven't deciphered it yet, Al-Abbas  was also someone who was in a better financial state, who was skilled in his trade and often is referenced in regard to his successful business endeavours, when we're talking about some of these other people.
You might remember that when Hamza  was martyred, that, these families, Banu Hashim, they wanted to take care of each other's children.
And when Hamza 's daughter was left behind after he was martyred, Ali, Ja'far and Zayd all wanted to raise the daughter of Hamza .
And the Prophet  says that if Zayd is killed, Ja’far should take command.
if Zayd is killed, then you immediately look to Ja’far and he is your commander.
And if Ja’far is killed, then you appoint Abdullah ibn Rawaha.
And if Abdullah ibn Rawaha is killed, then choose amongst you at that moment the best commander, ?
That the Prophet  was talking about all these different scenarios and that if this person dies, appoint this person, if this person dies, appoint this person.
And they are more skilled warriors, and this is meant to be a statement sent to the Muslims by the Byzantine empire, ?
Zayd ibn Harithah, the beloved one of the Prophet , was killed almost immediately.
he has both of his arms cut off and then he is stabbed and killed with over 70 wounds to his body and he passes away.
He becomes a shaheed, a martyr in the battle of Mu'tah.
He goes forth and he dies.
And when the news came, she says that when the news came of the death of Ja'far, we saw this grief overcome the face of the Prophet .
On top of this Zayd, his son , who in Jahiliyya, who he adopted as a son and his beloved one also was killed in this battle.
you talk about the difficulty of breaking the news, and the Prophet  himself is really hurting over the death of Ja'far.
the Prophet  says that he's been killed.
And he , he left the home, and this is where we  find the famous narration where the Prophet  , “Make food for the family of Ja'far  because they are busy with the news that has come to them.”  this is where we find the sunnah of taking care of the family when they are dealing with death in the family.
Because Ja'far  was murdered or martyred during the Prophet's 's life, we don't have hadiths narrated by Ja'far  himself, instead we have a hadith narrated about him by primarily Umm Salama, who was of course in Abyssinia, Abu Huraira bin Mas'ud and his son Abdullah bin Ja'far who we mentioned would grow up to be a famous companion and would narrate many hadith from the Prophet .
As for Asma’ bint Umais, may Allah be pleased with her, when we talk about the way that the companions used to marry the widows, Asma’ bint Umais, you might have heard her name already a few times as we're going through the stories of these people Asma’ bint Umais  after the death of Ja'far was married to none other than Abu Bakr as-Siddiq .
She is the woman who performed the ghusl of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  when he passed away, and she's also the woman who helped prepare the body of Fatima  when she passed away.
When Fatima  dies, Ali  sometime afterwards then proposes to her and marries her and it  that Asma’ bint Umais, she turned down a ton of proposals.
But then when Ali came, she accepted his proposal, and she married Ali  and she'd even live past Ali and she wouldn't marry after Ali  was martyred.
