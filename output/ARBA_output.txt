--- Lineage Overview ---
First and foremost, before Islam his name was not Abdurrahman but it was Abdu Amr or Abdul Ka'ba, and we know that the Prophet  used to change the names of those who had names that were contradictory to Islam.
He would not change everyone's name when they became Muslim, but if there was something inherently negative about their name, something that was pessimistic, had a bad meaning or included being a servant to anyone but Allah , then the Prophet  would change your name.
And Rasulullah  gave him the most beloved of names to Allah, as he   that the most beloved of names to Allah are Abdurrahman and Abdullah.
he named him  Abdurrahman, and his nickname was Abu Muhammad.
As far as his tribe is concerned, he is also from the tribe of Banu Zuhra, and we know that this was the tribe of Saad ibn Abi Waqqas , and this was also the tribe of the mother of the Prophet , Amina bint Wahab.
two of the ten promised paradise are related to the Prophet  through his mother by being from Banu Zuhra.
it's a powerful tribe, and that's of course where his father is from.
His mother her name is Ash-Shifa, and we don't have much about her.
as far as his connection to other tribes is concerned, we know that Abdurrahman was married to multiple women before Islam, and this connected him to multiple tribes within Quraish.
Abdurrahman says to him, “May Allah bless you with your family and with your wealth.
some of the marketplaces were under the tribe of some of the Jewish tribes that used to exist in Medina.
Some of them were under certain tribes that might have been hostile to the Muslims,  he's looking at these different marketplaces and he's saying  let me see if I can wiggle my way in the souq of Banu Qurayza, the souq of Banu Qaynuqa, all of these different marketplaces.
May Allah  bless you in your family and in your wealth.”  Abdurrahman bin Auf being the first of the muhajireen that we know those that migrated from Mecca to have a wedding in Medina and he did it all by himself, meaning he did not take up the generous offer of his sponsor and Sa'ad bin Rabir to take some of his wealth or some of his gardens to be able to do that.
And of course, if you remember Abdurahman ibn Auf's sister, Hind, was married to Bilal.
And we also find that once, as the Prophet  was preparing to dispatch a force, a mission, and Rasulullah  asked for people to sponsor it, that Abdurahman ibn Auf goes home and he brings back 2,000 coins for the Prophet  and Rasulullah  says, “What have you left behind?” He , “O Rasulullah, I give 2,000 for the sake of Allah and I left 2,000 for my family.”  giving half of your wealth for an expedition is pretty significant and this is something that he constantly would do with the Prophet  in multiple expeditions.
And if Allah  gives you victory, then propose to the daughter of the chief of the tribe.” This was a very specific advice that the Prophet  gave to him,, and of course this was a way of softening the hearts of tribes that were hostile and bringing people together.
Abdurahman ibn Auf did what he was told and he married the daughter of the chief of the tribe and through that marriage, his most prominent son was born, and that was Abu Salama ibn Abdurahman ibn Auf, who would go on to become one of the seven jurists of Medina who were famous.
you think about how crucial the role he plays in the transmission of the religion, and it came from this marriage that the Prophet  gave him advice and told him  to marry the daughter of the chief of that tribe.
For one, Abdurrahman ibn Auf used to take care of our mothers.
And that's something that's just extremely beautiful that you take it upon yourself to  our mothers and think about your blood mother, someone who took care of your mother.
These are our mothers, the wives of the Prophet , and this is the man who  I will care for all of them.
A part of his salary went to the widows, the wives of the Prophet , our mothers in particular.
There is a narration that one time, he sold a piece of land for forty thousand dinars and he distributed the entire amount among the Banu Zuhra, who were the relatives of the Prophet ’s mother,, and among the Prophet  wives, and the poor amongst the Muslims, and Aisha  received that huge amount of money.
That one time someone served him an extravagant meal of bread and meat and  he started to cry, and he  that the Prophet  passed away from this world and he and his family never once got to eat to their fill of bread or barley just to have the basics of this world, they never got it .
it could have been that Abdurrahman ibn Auf was going to be the khalifah of the Muslims and of course Abdurrahman ibn Auf had a very similar personality to Uthman , known for his generosity yet his great modesty and humility and  when the man heard, Hamran was his name, he heard that Uthman  ordered that, he went to Abdurrahman ibn Auf in the masjid, he  “Glad tidings.” He , “What is it?” He , “Uthman has written that you will succeed him.” And Abdurrahman ibn Auf went between the grave of the Prophet  and the minbar of the Prophet , meaning he's in the Rawdah.
And all of that and his family, his actual inheritors, still had a lot of money that was left behind for them.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
he had a powerful position, and of course he was extremely wealthy, and he is one of those who accepted Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq .
It is Muhammad .” And he took me to the home of Khadija  that day to embrace Islam.
Abdurrahman Ibn Auf is again one of the first 10 or 15 to accept Islam before Dar al-Arqam, and who would know the Prophet  before the Prophet  would formally start to gather the people and teach them.
We also find that one of the rulings of accepting jizya from the Zoroastrians was also taken from Abdurrahman ibn Auf, who , “I heard it from the Prophet  and saw it from the Prophet .”  the ruling of jizya from Ahlul Kitab was not specific to Ahlul Kitab, but applied to these other religious communities as well, that they would be protected under the jizya.

--- Persecution ---
he's in a vulnerable situation, being a refugee fleeing persecution in Mecca, and he's with this man whom he doesn't know.
He was the one that took as a prisoner, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who of course used to torture Bilal  and Bilal  was the one who killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf.
he  everyone in Medina was somehow living off the sadaqa of this man and the only one that would beat him at times was again Uthman ibn Affan .

--- Hijra ---
He stayed under the radar in Mecca, but he was persecuted, and we see that Abdurrahman Ibn Auf was one of those who made the first migration to Abyssinia and then came back, and he stayed back in Mecca until the migration to Al-Madinah.
last week we talked about Abu Ubaidah , who only made the second migration to Abyssinia, and this week we talk about Abdurrahman Ibn Auf, who only made the first migration to Abyssinia and came back and spent time with the Prophet  and waited until the order to migrate to Al-Madinah.
And we see that the Prophet   appointed him to lead one of those missions, and something significant that happened and this was the fifth year of Hijrah that as the Prophet  was dispatching him, the Prophet  took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself.

--- Battle ---
Then he worked up enough money  to start trading in horses, and he knew horses from his time in Mecca.
Then as he started to trade horses, Abdurrahman ibn Auf started to sell horse saddles.
Rather we find that he participated in every battle with the Prophet ,  he did not take a posture of ‘O Rasulullah, I'm wealthy and I'm not going to go out and battle or get my clothes dirty alongside you.’ Instead we find that he maintained a closeness to the Prophet  in battle just  all of the 10 promised paradise.
They always found themselves near the Prophet  in battle, seeking to protect the messenger .
some of the stories that we have from him in battle, one of them if you remember when we talked about Bilal .
And we also find that once, as the Prophet  was preparing to dispatch a force, a mission, and Rasulullah  asked for people to sponsor it, that Abdurahman ibn Auf goes home and he brings back 2,000 coins for the Prophet  and Rasulullah  says, “What have you left behind?” He , “O Rasulullah, I give 2,000 for the sake of Allah and I left 2,000 for my family.”  giving half of your wealth for an expedition is pretty significant and this is something that he constantly would do with the Prophet  in multiple expeditions.
And we see that the Prophet   appointed him to lead one of those missions, and something significant that happened and this was the fifth year of Hijrah that as the Prophet  was dispatching him, the Prophet  took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself.
just think of the scene and as he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf, he put his hand on his head , and he made dua for him and as he made dua for him, he advised him to have taqwa, as the Prophet  would always do when he sends someone out on a military mission.
He advises them to be pious, to be mindful of Allah  and that means on a personal level, to always be in a state of preparation to meet your Lord and also to be mindful of Allah, to not transgress because a lot of things happen in the capacity of battle, and the Muslims have to abide by a certain level of ethic.
you think about how crucial the role he plays in the transmission of the religion, and it came from this marriage that the Prophet  gave him advice and told him  to marry the daughter of the chief of that tribe.
And Khalid  was new to Islam and Khalid   some words to Abdurrahman ibn Auf as they were arguing in the wake of a battle, and the Prophet  was saying to Khalid , “Do not curse my companions or abuse my companions.”  of course, for us, this applies to all of the sahaba of the Prophet , but when the Prophet  spoke to the sahaba, there were of course degrees amongst the sahaba and the Prophet  always gave preference to the firsts and those that came to Islam early on.
the famous story of Jaysh al Usra, which was a difficult campaign where the Prophet  asked who would come forward, and Uthman  came forward with the most, we see that Abdurrahman ibn Auf  donated 20 or 200 pounds of gold in Jaysh al Usra.
It was  in Tabuk, and Bilal  looked around he used to go to the Prophet  to ask the Prophet  if he should do the adhan, the Prophet  would give him the permission, he'd go make the adhan and then the Prophet  would come and lead the companions in prayer.
And that one rak'ah of the Prophet , can you imagine how long it was to Abdurrahman ibn Auf who doesn't know if he sinned at this point or if he made a mistake  the Prophet  finished his salah, he looked towards them and the Prophet  , “You did well.” 

 he put them at ease  and he once again reaffirmed  that you pray your prayers on time,  you did well.
And she , “Who sent this money?” They , “It's Abdurrahman.” And Aisha  remembered that the Prophet   that, “Oh Aisha, no one will feel compassion towards you after I die except for the righteous.” Meaning only a righteous person will rise to the occasion to take care of the wives of the Prophet  after he passes away, and that was Abdurrahman ibn Auf.
Either I will get them to take money without permission,  they  take money and wrong, or I will get them to spend it without their , or I will make it  beloved to that person that he obstructs its rightful use.
I am afraid that we are amongst those for whom the goodness of this world or for whom our reward has been hastened in this world.”
Meaning what is left for us is the punishment of the hereafter.
Asalaamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.

--- Virtue(s) ---
Abdurrahman Ibn Auf is again one of the first 10 or 15 to accept Islam before Dar al-Arqam, and who would know the Prophet  before the Prophet  would formally start to gather the people and teach them.
He stayed under the radar in Mecca, but he was persecuted, and we see that Abdurrahman Ibn Auf was one of those who made the first migration to Abyssinia and then came back, and he stayed back in Mecca until the migration to Al-Madinah.
last week we talked about Abu Ubaidah , who only made the second migration to Abyssinia, and this week we talk about Abdurrahman Ibn Auf, who only made the first migration to Abyssinia and came back and spent time with the Prophet  and waited until the order to migrate to Al-Madinah.
May Allah  bless you in your family and in your wealth.”  Abdurrahman bin Auf being the first of the muhajireen that we know those that migrated from Mecca to have a wedding in Medina and he did it all by himself, meaning he did not take up the generous offer of his sponsor and Sa'ad bin Rabir to take some of his wealth or some of his gardens to be able to do that.
And Khalid  was new to Islam and Khalid   some words to Abdurrahman ibn Auf as they were arguing in the wake of a battle, and the Prophet  was saying to Khalid , “Do not curse my companions or abuse my companions.”  of course, for us, this applies to all of the sahaba of the Prophet , but when the Prophet  spoke to the sahaba, there were of course degrees amongst the sahaba and the Prophet  always gave preference to the firsts and those that came to Islam early on.
There are other narrations about his virtues and they are plentiful and I'll go through some of my favourite and I could literally go all night talking about Abdurrahman ibn Auf, and how the companions spoke about this man that was  generous with his wealth and generous with his heart and generous with his spirit.
the generous know the generous.
Bilal  and those that were there, appointed Abdurrahman ibn Auf to lead the salah, which tells you about his position in the first place.
The first type of patience is the patience of hardship, and that is when something happens to you, you're tested by Allah, and you are patient in your response.
Abdurrahman ibn Auf  was particularly instrumental in what would transpire next and Al-Dhahabi, he  says that it is from the greatest of his virtues was the way he handled himself on the shura of Umar  in choosing the next khalifah.
Rather, if you are generous and grateful that you will have that position with Allah and with the Messenger .

--- Death ---
he goes in there and he studies it.
He was the one that took as a prisoner, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who of course used to torture Bilal  and Bilal  was the one who killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf.
Now, after the death of the Prophet , we also see that Abdurrahman continued to play an important role in the community.
He took it upon himself to be the sole provider of the wives of the Prophet  after the Prophet  passed away.
One of them, he  , “We were tested with hardship with the messenger  and we were patient, but then we were tested with ease and prosperity after the prophet 's death and we were not patient.” What is he talking about?
He , “Hamza  was killed, and he did not have enough to even cover him in a kafan except for one garment.
And Mus'ab was killed, and he had nothing to cover him at his death except for the garment that he had for his death.
That one time someone served him an extravagant meal of bread and meat and  he started to cry, and he  that the Prophet  passed away from this world and he and his family never once got to eat to their fill of bread or barley just to have the basics of this world, they never got it .
One of them is that, of course, as we talked about with Abu Ubaidah al-Jarrah, he was the one who solved the discussion about how Muslims should act in the case of a plague.
In the plague of Amwas, he was the one who intervened in the argument between Umar  and Abu Ubaidah , when he , “Are you running away from the decree of Allah  by fleeing from the plague?” And Umar  , “We are fleeing from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah.” Meaning we are not being reckless, we are showing tawakkul, and this is how we show tawakkul by taking the means we trust Allah .
And it was Abdurrahman ibn Auf  , “I heard from the Prophet , that if a person is in a land and plague breaks out, they should not leave it, and if they are not in that land, then they should not go to it.”  it was he who intervened in that regard.
And then, finally, when we come to his death , we come to his role in the khilafah of Umar  and then Uthman  in the appointment of the khalifah.
, they're all in this illustrious category of being from the 10 that were promised paradise, and one of the narrations is that Uthman  once became sick, and he wrote in his will that if he passed away in this illness that Abdurrahman ibn Auf would be his successor.
And he , “Oh Allah, if it is indeed that Uthman  has entrusted me with this matter, let me die before he dies.”  that's powerful, ?
he immediately , “Oh Allah, if that's the case, if I'm going to be his successor, let me die before he dies.
I don't want to be tested with that responsibility.” 

And he did not live except for a few months after that, and he passed away due to natural causes before the fitnah would break out.
And before he passed away, he had this dream the night before he passed away and, in his dream, he looks behind him and the entire ummah is behind him.
it's an interesting dream that he shared with some of the companion before he passed away, and Ali ibn Abi Talib  describes the scene of his janaza.
And Ali  looking out at the janaza of Abdurrahman ibn Auf , he  those words, he , “What a sign,  this is Jannah being mandatory for him.” 

And  Abdurrahman ibn Auf  passed away at the age of about 75 years old and before he died, he liberated, they , hundreds or even thousands of slaves.
