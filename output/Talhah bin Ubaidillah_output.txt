--- Lineage Overview ---
Talhah ibn Ubaidillah, his full name is Talhah ibn Ubaidillah ibn Uthman ibn Amr al-Qurashi al-Taymi.
He was born into a wealthy tribe, and that tribe is known as Banu Taym.
And I'll talk a little bit about that tribe as well.
The protection of the tribe, the love of his people.
Let's talk a little bit about his tribe because there is a notable feature of this tribe of Banu Taym.
First and foremost, it's the tribe of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq.
He's the second cousin of Abu Bakr and the son-in-law of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq.
, he's from the same tribe as Abu Bakr.
He's a second cousin.
May Allah  be pleased with the family of Abu Bakr.
, you already have the most distinct person after the Prophet  from his tribe and closely related to him.
From this tribe was also a man by the name of Abdullah ibn Jud'an.
His mother, her name was As-Sa'ba bint Abdullah, and she was from the Hadhram tribe.
And her brother, meaning the maternal uncle of Talhah, was a companion who is not often spoken about, but he is a Sahabi by the name of Al-Alaa ibn al-Hadhrami.
One of the things about Talhah as well is that he was married to several women of high lineage.
And , he was not just from a powerful and notable tribe of Banu Taym, but he's also linked to various tribes because he would marry women of the highest ranking from the highest tribe.
, he is connected to multiple tribes in Mecca from a very young age.
Well respected, he has lineage, he has wealth, he has good character.
And that was the name by which he was prophesized.
because Talhah was  prominent in his reputation and he's from Banu Taym, he's still going to undergo punishment at the hands of his own tribe.
Naufal, who is the brother of Khadijah, whom the Prophet  called the devil of Quraysh.
And  that's why Naufal, when he did that, Abu Bakr and Talhah were nicknamed Al-Qarinayn, the two Qarins, the two close companions, the two tied ones.
And  Mas'ud , “And I , “Who is the woman behind him?” And they responded and they , “This is his mother As-Sa'aba bint Al-Hadhrami.
But of course, he was initially tortured and punished by his mother As-Safiyyah bint Abdul Muttalib.
Now, when the Prophet  decides to make the Hijrah, Talhah  met the Prophet  and Abu Bakr, who was his father-in-law, on the way out of Mecca, and he was coming back from Ash-Sham.
he goes to Abu Bakr and the Prophet , he gives them what he gives them, and then he makes his way to Mecca, and Talhah is  the person that would accompany the family of Abu Bakr to Medina on the Hijrah.
And of course, that's at the very end, when Abu Bakr had already left with the Prophet , Talhah brings the family of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq forward, and then joins the Prophet  and the companions in Al-Medina.
When he arrives in Medina, the Prophet  of course did mu'akha, he paired off people as brothers.
, Abu Ayyub is considered the brother of Talhah ibn Ubaidillah.
, while they were out looking for this particular caravan of Abu Sufyan in a place called Hawra, they heard about the battle of Badr that had already taken place while they were on their way back.
Jabir says, “Every time the Prophet  would , “Who is for the people?” Talhah would , “Me, O Rasulullah.” Just  Az-Zubayr, every time the Prophet  called out, Talhah would be there.
And that's why Talhah from that day forward was called the living martyr, he was a walking shaheed.
Umm Ishaq bint Talhah, the daughter of Talhah, she says that “My father had 24 wounds on his body from that day that never even fully healed”.
Because of his generosity, and because of his goodness, the Prophet  gave him three nicknames beyond “the living shaheed”.
The Prophet  called him Talhah the good one, Talhah the generous one, and Talhah who is the beneficent one.
, he receives three nicknames from the Prophet .
And of course, when Umar was passing away, as we know, he appointed to his shura all of those that were from the Ten Promised Paradise, with the exception of Sa'eed ibn Zayd because Sa'eed ibn Zayd was his brother-in-law.
And after he led the janazah of Talhah, he called the people forward.
He called the people forward, and he had the son of Talhah, Muhammad ibn Talhah, sit next to him on the chair of the khalifah.
And he , “I ask Allah to make your father and me amongst those who are mentioned in the ayah, And we have removed from their chest, from their hearts, all grudges and put them as brothers upon these thrones facing one another.” , you can imagine the scene in this situation, ?
Now, a few interesting things about the family of Talhah.
Talhah was married to four sisters-in-law of the Prophet .
, when we talk about the way that he was married to different tribes and the lineage and the connection that he had beyond being just the son-in-law of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq.
He has a unique distinction of being married to four of the sisters-in-law of the Prophet .
, these are Al-Fari'ah bint Abu Sufyan of course being the sister of Umm Habibah.
Ruqayya bint Abu Umayya is the sister of Umm Salama.
Umm Kulthum of course being the sister of Aisha.
And Hamna being the sister of Zainab bint Jahsh.
, he's married to four of the sisters-in-law of the Prophet .
Lastly, and I think this is extremely beautiful, the names that he chose for his kids.
If you remember, we  Zubayr would name his children after martyrs.
Talhah would name his children after prophets.
His children's names are Muhammad, Imran, Musa, Yaqub, Ismail, Ishaq, Zakariya, Yahya, Yusuf, and Isa.
, he named his sons all after the prophets of Allah .
Her name is Aisha bint Talhah, and she becomes known as one of the greatest scholars of hadith and fiqh in Medina.
She was sought after, narrated from, and her primary teacher is the one that she is named after, Aisha bint Abi Bakr who is also her aunt.
May Allah  be pleased with all of the companions of the Prophet  and join us with them and with the Prophet  as brothers and sisters in the highest companionship.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
If he has come out, you should hurry up and you should embrace him and meet him quickly.” Talhah , I just had a feeling that there was something deep to what he was saying.
Talhah goes with Abu Bakr, he meets the Prophet , he hears the message of Islam once again affirmed from the mouth of the Messenger  himself, the message of the oneness of God, and Talhah accepts Islam alongside Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, and he is considered the eighth person potentially, again all of these numbers if you haven't figured out by now, can be somewhat approximate, but he's considered the eighth person or one of the first eight to accept Islam only at the age of 18 years old.
He gave up his religion and he now follows the man from Banu Hashim.” , you can see the tribalism even in how they're describing the way that Talhah embraced the message of the Prophet .

--- Persecution ---
And I know it's been a while since we've covered Abu Bakr, but you might remember that Abu Bakr and Talhah were tortured together.
Literally, Naufal ibn Khuwaylid tied Abu Bakr and Talhah up with one rope, and he violently tortured them.
And he also brought others to violently beat them while they were tied together by their hands and by their feet.
But of course, he was initially tortured and punished by his mother As-Safiyyah bint Abdul Muttalib.
However, for the most part, Talhah was able to escape the punishments the persecutions in Mecca for a few reasons.
After they had already left Mecca, he also informed them of some of the ways in which Medina was awaiting the Prophet  and what he was hearing outside of Mecca about the escape of the Prophet  from the persecution of Mecca.

--- Hijra ---
And  he was not amongst those that made the migration to Abyssinia, even though Az-Zubayr, who is such a close friend of his, his best friend, to the point that their stories are  one story.
Now, when the Prophet  decides to make the Hijrah, Talhah  met the Prophet  and Abu Bakr, who was his father-in-law, on the way out of Mecca, and he was coming back from Ash-Sham.
he goes to Abu Bakr and the Prophet , he gives them what he gives them, and then he makes his way to Mecca, and Talhah is  the person that would accompany the family of Abu Bakr to Medina on the Hijrah.

--- Battle ---
The people used to come and poke them with their swords.
And in the crowd was an old woman who was lashing him with a whip as well, and she was shouting the worst of things towards him.” , I , “What is the matter with this young man?” And they , “This is Talhah ibn Ubaidillah.
And she was the one who was whipping Talhah and shouting all sorts of abuses towards him.” , he shares a lot of similarity then in that sense from Az-Zubayr.
And of course, that's at the very end, when Abu Bakr had already left with the Prophet , Talhah brings the family of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq forward, and then joins the Prophet  and the companions in Al-Medina.
Now his story with the battle of Badr is particularly interesting because he missed it.
He missed it because the Prophet  sent him and Sa'eed ibn Zayd, of course another one of the Ten Promised Paradise, on a mission to spy on one of the caravans of Abu Sufyan.
, while they were out looking for this particular caravan of Abu Sufyan in a place called Hawra, they heard about the battle of Badr that had already taken place while they were on their way back.
these two, Talhah and Sa'eed ibn Zayd are on their way to help the Prophet  to carry out this particular order from the Prophet , but in the process, they missed being alongside the Prophet  in the battle of Badr, and that pained Talhah .
Talhah is one of those people who missed Badr, and who longed for the moment to fight alongside the Prophet , and defend him against his enemies.
I missed the battle.” What does the Prophet   to him?
He says, “What about my reward?
I don't care if I have the spoils.” The Prophet , he says, “And you have the reward of Badr.”   Uthman, who of course missed Badr because he was tending to the daughter of the Prophet , his wife Ruqayya, and the Prophet  counted him from the veterans of Badr, which was a lofty reward.
Talhah and Sa'eed ibn Zayd are also counted from the veterans of Badr, even though they were not physically present at the Battle of Badr, which shows you, of course, the role of the sincerity of intention.
If a person was sincere, then they would have the full reward.
, because they had the full intention to go out and to protect the Prophet , to serve, they still got the full reward, even though they were out at the time, and they were not amongst those that would fight physically in Badr.
And you then see the different narrations, and they're throughout al-Bukhari, they're throughout Muslim, Ahmad and the books of seerah, that when the arrows were coming towards the messenger of Allah , Talhah was using his body and even his hands to catch the arrows that were coming towards the Prophet .
, just imagine the sight of the Prophet  being attacked and Talhah fighting from every side of him , and catching the arrows with one hand, using his sword with the other hand, and suffering wound after wound.
And Abu Bakr, he says at that moment, “Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and I, we were far away from the Prophet  because we were fighting off some of those that were coming forward.
And when we got close to the Prophet , the Prophet  , “Leave me and go towards your companion.” And what he meant by your companion, he meant Talhah.
One wound from a sword, one wound from a spear, one wound from an arrow, his foot had been cut, and he literally laid unconscious, and the blood was flowing from his mouth.
Somehow, he was still alive.” All of that, he took spears and swords and arrows defending the Prophet  and all that, somehow, he was alive.
Talhah fulfilled his obligation, and Jannah became obligated for Talhah, and the Prophet  , “Whoever wants to see a walking martyr, a shaheed who still lives, a shaheed who somehow survived, but is still walking on his feet, let him look at Talhah.” , even though Talhah survived that day, the Prophet  counted him amongst the shuhada of that day because of the amount of sacrifice that he put forward.
And that's why Talhah from that day forward was called the living martyr, he was a walking shaheed.
Even with that, he still fought every single battle with the Prophet .
Uhud onwards, despite the wounds that he suffered, despite not being able to even fully function with his  hand anymore, he still fought alongside the Prophet  with every single battle.
And on the Battle of Tabuk, we know about Uthman  coming forth on that day.
After the Prophet  passed away, we find that Talhah was one of the key warriors of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq  in the battle against Musaylimah Al-Kazzab.
, Talhah was, who felt  guilty for not being there at the time that Uthman was assassinated and not fighting on his behalf.
And you have the tragedy, truly the tragedy of the Battle of Al-Jamal.
And Talhah was amongst those that died in the Battle of Al-Jamal.
, he was killed in that battle.
And one of the most heartbreaking scenes, probably to encapsulate the fitnah, how tragic this was, was Ali going to the body of Talhah in battle.
When Ali finds the body of Talhah in battle, and he knows the position of Talhah, he kneeled and he put the head of Talhah in his lap, and he started to wipe the dirt off of his face.
And after he led the janazah of Talhah, he called the people forward.
He called the people forward, and he had the son of Talhah, Muhammad ibn Talhah, sit next to him on the chair of the khalifah.
He calls all of the people forward after leading the janazah of Talhah.
And he tells “Muhammad, sit next to me.” And he says, “There are some people that claim that only the foolish ones came out to fight.” He , “But this is the most honoured of faces that came out on the earth.” And he , “I heard the Prophet  , ‘Talhah biz-Zubayr jaraya fil-jannan”.
Talhah was killed in the battle.
And , he looked towards Muhammad, the son of Talhah.
And the pain that Ali felt and that the sahaba felt, because this was the first time that you had blood drawn in a war that included sahaba on both sides of that battle, even if it was provoked and instigated by people of fitnah.
But in this situation, the unfortunate consequence of this that you have the sahaba on both sides of this battle.
They  up to 74 wounds that he suffered fi sabilillah, on the cause of Allah , through all the battles alongside the Prophet .

--- Virtue(s) ---
And Talhah follows in that same mould of being a man who is extremely generous with the people and who is loved for his generosity.
Talhah goes with Abu Bakr, he meets the Prophet , he hears the message of Islam once again affirmed from the mouth of the Messenger  himself, the message of the oneness of God, and Talhah accepts Islam alongside Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, and he is considered the eighth person potentially, again all of these numbers if you haven't figured out by now, can be somewhat approximate, but he's considered the eighth person or one of the first eight to accept Islam only at the age of 18 years old.
And there are  many hadith witnessing the heroic courage that Talhah displayed on that day, never leaving the side of the Prophet .
Now, does it make sense when we , that the Prophet  , “Talhah and Zubayr are my two neighbours in Jannah.” Az-Zubayr, the first one to rush to the Prophet  in Mecca, because he heard that the Prophet  was attacked, that young man that , “I'm going to defend you, Oh Rasulullah.” And Talhah, who rushed to the side of the Prophet  on the day where he almost died and had the side, the back, the front of the Prophet  throughout and almost died in the process.
Number one, obviously his courage.
Talhah was a man of extreme courage.
The Prophet  called him Talhah the good one, Talhah the generous one, and Talhah who is the beneficent one.
And he , I have never seen a man who was more generous with his money, with his clothes and with his food than Talhah.
Now, when we get to the life of Uthman particularly, and I'm not going to go too deep into the trials and tribulations as I have not done because the focus of this series has been the first, meaning the beginning and how they came to Islam and their contributions and speaking to their qualities, but just getting to the end of this.
And that night, the same people who caused the massive fitnah in Medina in the first place, knowing that the two armies or the two groups were going to come together, what did they do at night?
And the pain that Ali felt and that the sahaba felt, because this was the first time that you had blood drawn in a war that included sahaba on both sides of that battle, even if it was provoked and instigated by people of fitnah.
He narrates about 20 hadith and that's because he was noted for his courage and his generosity.

--- Death ---
Of course, it's sunnah to visit the martyrs of Uhud themselves.
Talhah fulfilled his obligation, and Jannah became obligated for Talhah, and the Prophet  , “Whoever wants to see a walking martyr, a shaheed who still lives, a shaheed who somehow survived, but is still walking on his feet, let him look at Talhah.” , even though Talhah survived that day, the Prophet  counted him amongst the shuhada of that day because of the amount of sacrifice that he put forward.
And that's why Talhah from that day forward was called the living martyr, he was a walking shaheed.
If you just talked about Uhud alone, and Abu Bakr  is saying, that's the day of Talhah, and the Prophet  saying, “Whoever wants to see a living martyr, this is who you look at”.
Because of his generosity, and because of his goodness, the Prophet  gave him three nicknames beyond “the living shaheed”.
Of course Abu Bakr As-Siddiq , they used to  that the Prophet  passed away and he was pleased with you.
After the Prophet  passed away, we find that Talhah was one of the key warriors of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq  in the battle against Musaylimah Al-Kazzab.
If we think about it in the sense of sacrifice and selflessness, he , “Oh Allah, take from me for Uthman until you are pleased.” Meaning, let me suffer, let me be killed, let me be hurt, let me go through all sorts of pain.
They gave the bay'ah, they gave the pledge to go to Mecca and to die in Hudaybiyyah when they thought that Uthman had been killed.
, he was killed in that battle.
Of course, Talhah and Zubayr the neighbours of the Prophet  were killed on that day.
Talhah was killed in the battle.
, Talhah was killed that day.
There's an interesting dream about Talhah after his death.
That a man has seen Talhah after his death.
After his death, Sa'id ibn Musayyib, he narrates that there was a man that was cursing Ali and Talhah and Az-Zubayr.
If you remember, we  Zubayr would name his children after martyrs.
