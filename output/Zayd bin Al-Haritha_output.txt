--- Lineage Overview ---
His nickname is the loved one of the Prophet , the beloved of the beloved .
The nickname of this companion?
Zayd ibn Haritha is nicknamed the beloved of the beloved .
First, let's start with who he's from or what his family is.
Zayd's father is Harithah ibn Sharahil.
He was from an Arab tribe known as Banu Kalb and it was a prominent tribe.
His mother was a woman by the name of Su'adah bint Tha'laba from the Tayy tribe.
He's not  Bilal or Khabbab or the others that were born into that situation or whose families were captured in some sort of war.
Zayd was on a trip with his mother to visit some of their relatives, the relatives of his mother.
And as Zayd and his mother, Su'adah were on their way outside of Mecca, Zayd , we went to sleep that night on the way there.
Now when they attacked Zayd and his mother, they stole all of their food, they stole all of their money and ultimately, they kidnapped him also.
Zayd was taken from his mother as a very young child in this situation but he could recall the incident precisely.
And the name of the tribe that took him was a tribe by the name of Banu al-Qayn.
Banu al-Qayn was known as a military tribe.
They were a tribe of troops, they were rough, they accepted Islam after the death of the Prophet .
Zayd recalls this incident where he says that he was asleep next to his mother and it was just him and his mother traveling and suddenly this group of men attacked, they stole everything, took him from his mother and they immediately took him to the slave market of the time, Suq al-Uqaz.
Zayd is in the slave market, his mother and his father were searching for him, they could not find him.
And Haritha in particular, the father of Zayd had a deep love for him and he used to author poetry.
And it's a very heartbreaking poem because you can see the grief of a father for his son.
And , you imagine you've got a father and a mother that are essentially looking for this child that's been kidnapped and he's in a slave market and they have no idea what has happened to him.
He wasn't born into this.
There's no ransom for him.” , you're his father.
He can go back with his family.
He can go back with his father and his mother.
the Prophet  called for Zayd.
The history of Zayd and the conflict inside of him already, his father is coming to him to bring him back to his home.
He's grown up in a house where he's been shown a lot of love and respect, and Zayd also now has to deal with the sudden reality that his father showed up after all of these years, and he has to make a choice.
when Zayd came, the Prophet   to Zayd, “Do you recognize these two?” Just to make sure it's not someone just claiming to be his father and then not really his father.
The Prophet  , “Who are they?” He , “It's my father and my uncle.” The Prophet  told him that you're free to go with them, no ransom, no nothing.
He  go back with your father, go back with your uncle.
And when his father heard that, his father , “Oh Zayd, are you going to choose slavery over freedom?
And over your father, over your mother, over your city?” Because remember they weren't from the people of Mecca, and your people.
It's not that he does not  his father, he blames him, but he's developed a relationship now with the Prophet  of those sorts.
Haritha says, “What does your master do with you?” And Zayd's response, “He treats me better than he treats his own kids and his own family.” That's how Zayd described the treatment of the Prophet  and Khadijah with that.
Now the Prophet  derived that the father of Zayd was more concerned with his well-being.
After Zayd  that the Prophet  treats me better than he treats his own family and his own children, the Prophet  says, bear witness that he is free, he already freed him, this is my son, he inherits from me, and I inherit from him.
When the Prophet  announced that, Zayd’s father was pleased.
he married from that most noble of tribes.
He also at some point married Umm Kulthum bint Uqba, who was a sister of Uthman.
He was also engaged to Fakhita bint Abi Lahab, one of the daughters of Abu Lahab, the uncle of the Prophet .
The uncle that would of course announce, that would oppress the Prophet  more than anyone else when he announced his Islam.
The one who is named in the Quran as a humiliated one, who cursed the Prophet  as he stood up on Safa and called the people to this new way of life.
Zayd was also engaged to the sister of those two men who were engaged to the daughters of the Prophet .
Especially, he's already lost Khadijah, he's lost Abu Talib, he's lost his closest family, Mecca is bleak, it has no hope.
Zayd was also sent back in the Hijrah to accompany the family of the Prophet .
And specifically, an Ansari is a person or the brothers of the Muhajireen were those who took them into their own households and shared half of everything with their brothers and sisters from Mecca.
But the Prophet  paired Zayd with Hamza, his uncle .
And in fact, Hamza, the uncle of the Prophet , entrusted Zayd with his last testament.
And  if you think about this by the way, Hamza is the grand uncle of Zayd in that context.
there's a family relationship there.
Who the Prophet  called my mom after my mom.
Purchased by the father of the Prophet .
And of course, as a young woman, cared for the Prophet  when he was born.
As he was born into this world, and we talked about how special Umm Ayman was.
How in the world does Zayd, the son, marry the woman who is  a mother to the Prophet .
Usama ibn Zayd was  beloved to the Prophet  that his nickname was the beloved one, the son of the beloved one of the Prophet .
Punishments were only taken, pretty much what happens now by the way, harsh punishments are exacted on poor people of no class, no tribe.
If you're from a noble tribe, it's very easy, you get a connection, call it off.
Now in the process,  you've got this special family now, you've got Umm Ayman, Zayd, Usama ibn Zayd.
In the process of the Prophet  trying to break the social hierarchies and structures that existed in society, he wanted to marry people from different tribes and different classes to one another to shatter that.
If someone was from a tribe that was generally disregarded, they couldn't just marry from there.
The Prophet  wanted to break the marital hierarchy in terms of wealth, in terms of social status, in terms of tribe.
And , you find  many examples of this where the Prophet  insists on people from different tribes formulating a marriage, people in terms of different status, in terms of the superficiality of how beauty is judged.
Allah  from now on, people should be called in accordance with their actual families.
But one of the objectives of the religion is the preservation of lineage.
Zayd is the only companion of the Prophet , male or female, who is mentioned by name in the Quran.
Who when you  his name, in recitation, that is a form of worship and a form of keeping that act of worship to Allah .
Zayd gets a special distinction in the process of that dissolution of the marriage of Zayd and Zaynab, and instead is named in the Quran.
And not only did Zayd die in the battle of Mu'tah, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib who we will have a session about the cousin of the Prophet  died in Mu'tah.
For him to have that nickname is very special, and it's a form of closeness to Allah and to his Messenger , as is the case with his son Usama ibn Zayd.
Not because he didn't put his son down, he  the Prophet  loved his father more than he loved me, and loved him, meaning Usama ibn Zayd, more than you.
now he's saying, look, the Prophet loved his father Zayd more than he loved me, he loved Usama ibn Zayd more than he loved you, and the Prophet  appointed Usama ibn Zayd a commander over me.
The fact that the Prophet  treated him  a son, treated him  well that Zayd could testify even before Islam, that the Prophet  treated me better than he would treat his kids and that he would treat his own family.
And that's  a consistent theme when you look at the family of the Prophet , that being part of his family meant that you were involved more in the sacrifice, not sheltered from the sacrifice of the Messenger , which was an example of his servant leadership .

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
And Zayd, we know him as the first freed slave to accept Islam, the first of the mawali to accept Islam.
They were a tribe of troops, they were rough, they accepted Islam after the death of the Prophet .
Now, when did Zayd accept Islam?
It's  not specified, but he's recognized as the first mawla, the first freed man to accept Islam.
The first of the mawali to accept Islam at the hands of the Prophet .
The Prophet is desperately looking for someone to accept him and to give him protection from the persecution of Mecca.

--- Persecution ---
it's torture to not know for a fact, you can have an idea, you can think that he's been killed or taken to Ash-Sham, or taken to the Roman Empire because they live far away from Mecca.
It's at the last stages of persecution in Mecca.
The Prophet is desperately looking for someone to accept him and to give him protection from the persecution of Mecca.
He literally, the Prophet , remembered, even his shoes being full of stones at that point because of the amount of times that he was knocked over, and the amount of torture that took place with the Prophet .
He saw the Prophet  go under a tree to seek respite, after having walked and being beaten for how long?
If you  measure the stretch, the path of where the Prophet  was beaten, imagine he would have walked 15 miles, beaten, tortured, turned away.
And of course, Zayd himself was covered in blood and took a beating in those moments trying to protect the Prophet .

--- Hijra ---
Zayd was also sent back in the Hijrah to accompany the family of the Prophet .
Zayd was the one who accompanied, remember, Fatima and Ali were not married yet,  he accompanied Fatima, Saudah, Umm Kulthum, and the household of the Prophet  on that migration, on that Hijrah as the Prophet  went out in Mecca.

--- Battle ---
He's not  Bilal or Khabbab or the others that were born into that situation or whose families were captured in some sort of war.
But they were all very skilled warriors, and they had a large contingent of them that were bandits, that were highway robbers, that would especially attack people on the outskirts of the cities where they could do  under the darkness of the night and get away with it.
Zayd was an extremely talented warrior.
He was very talented in battle.
He fought in all of the battles with the Prophet .
In the battle of Badr, in the battle of Uhud, in Al-Khandaq, in Khaybar.
Zayd would, as I , go out and command the armies as the Prophet  commissioned them.
He led the expeditions, and he led the expedition of the battle of Mu'tah, which was a very difficult battle.
the numbers were extremely disproportionate in that battle as the Romans were encroaching upon the Muslims in these times.
And not only did Zayd die in the battle of Mu'tah, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib who we will have a session about the cousin of the Prophet  died in Mu'tah.
There were very close people to the Prophet  that died and that were martyred in this battle.
But instead, it was revealed through Jibreel AS before the news of the army, before the news of the battle would even get back from the area of Jordan.
And when the Prophet  passed away, he had appointed Usama ibn Zayd in charge of the expedition of the Muslims that would fight against the Romans, and the Muslims won under Usama.

--- Virtue(s) ---
And Zayd, we know him as the first freed slave to accept Islam, the first of the mawali to accept Islam.
It's  not specified, but he's recognized as the first mawla, the first freed man to accept Islam.
The first of the mawali to accept Islam at the hands of the Prophet .
Was the first one to hold the Prophet .
These were the people that had to come together for hilf al-fudul (Alliance of Virtue), to protect the lowest amongst them, because it was just  tribal that it was easy to be taken advantage of.
that's one of the virtues of Zayd.
The hadith is an authentic hadith from Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, the first Khalifah, in praise of Zayd ibn Haritha.
But what we do take from it, the only real beneficial thing beyond just trying to spend hours and hours, now I'm going to go compare the virtues of Zayd to the virtues of Abu Bakr, who the Prophet   was the best person that ever walked the face of the earth after the Prophets.

--- Death ---
They were a tribe of troops, they were rough, they accepted Islam after the death of the Prophet .
But they were all very skilled warriors, and they had a large contingent of them that were bandits, that were highway robbers, that would especially attack people on the outskirts of the cities where they could do  under the darkness of the night and get away with it.
Or has he been overtaken by death?” Meaning I'm looking for closure at this point.
it's torture to not know for a fact, you can have an idea, you can think that he's been killed or taken to Ash-Sham, or taken to the Roman Empire because they live far away from Mecca.
Was it Uhud, when he almost died, and many of his companions were killed?
There were very close people to the Prophet  that died and that were martyred in this battle.
Jibreel AS came to the Prophet  and  informed him of the deaths of Zayd, Ja'far and Abdullah ibn Rawaha.
And the Prophet  ascended the pulpit to announce the news that Jibreel AS, the angel, had informed him of the loss of the Muslims and the deaths of those noble people.
And the Prophet  was weeping as he announced the death of his son Zayd, who was  his son, even though he was Zayd ibn Harithah, who grew up in the household of the Prophet .
What does that mean, or how do we also contextualize that one other thing is that who did the Prophet  put in charge of the army after his death?
And when the Prophet  passed away, he had appointed Usama ibn Zayd in charge of the expedition of the Muslims that would fight against the Romans, and the Muslims won under Usama.
