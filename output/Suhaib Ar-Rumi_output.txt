--- Lineage Overview ---
His father was a ruler, a leader amongst the Persians.
And his father was an Arab named Sinan ibn Malik.
And his father was  intelligent, was  advanced that on it appears to be a trade route with the Persian Empire or something along those sorts.
And  he's an Arab governor in a city by the name of Al-Ubulla.
Suhaib is an Arab kid growing up amongst the Persians but his father is a leader amongst the Persians which is very rare in and of itself.
And to make this even stranger, Suhaib was an Arab whose father was a governor in the Persian Empire who looked  a Roman kid.
he had white skin, he had blonde hair, and  he looked  a Roman but he was an Arab and he lived amongst the Persians where his father was a governor.
Suhaib was only five years old when his mother took him out for a picnic in a city that is in what was Ninaway, where Yunus AS is from.
in Ninaway in Iraq, they  it was an area by the name of Athani.
And as Suhaib's mother was playing with him, a group of Roman soldiers attacked that city and they took a large number of captives including Suhaib .
Suhaib is kidnapped as a five year old from the Persian Empire, or from the rule of the Persian Empire, taken back with the Byzantines, separated from his mother in the slave markets.
His mother was sold to one master, a slave master, who would take his mother away, and he'd never  see his mother again, he never saw his father again.
An Arab kid whose father was a governor in the Persian Empire, kidnapped by Roman soldiers, would remain as a slave amongst the Romans for about 20 years.
Being in the Persian lands, even though his father was royal amongst the Persian Empire, Suhaib remained disconnected from his roots, and now of course, being taken into slavery and sold over and over and over again for two decades.
Here you have an Arab kid that was born in Persia, enslaved by the Romans, looks  a Roman, looks  the Romans now, escaped now to Mecca.
Abdullah ibn Jad'an was the cousin of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq , the richest man in Mecca, a powerful man because of his wealth.
And the reason why Suhaib is called Suhaib al-Rumi, even though now he's amongst his people, is because even until the day he died, Suhaib did not speak  an Arab.
Suhaib is very wealthy, but he has no one to really protect that wealth because Suhaib is not from one of the tribes in Mecca, where he could be protected.
We know that the powerful, the elite amongst Quraysh, would be tortured privately by the elite of their own tribes.
Not low because of his wealth, low because Suhaib did not have a tribe in that area to protect him.
Suhaib was disregarded by the people of Mecca, even though he was an Arab, even though he was wealthy, because he didn't have a tribe.
He essentially was a Roman when he came to the Prophet  and  the name fit him as Suhaib al-Rumi , as he embraced Islam under those circumstances.
Which shows you how Islam truly turned these people into brothers across class, across journey, across race, across all of these different things, across tribe, of course, more than all of that.
He  number one, he  that “You have taken the Kunya of Abu Yahya, and you don't have a son named Yahya.
Suhaib  responded, and he , “As for the Kunya of Abu Yahya, the Prophet  called me Abu Yahya.
That was something that the Prophet   to me, and  I embraced that name because it was what the Prophet  called me.” And he says, “As for the ascription to the Arabs, it is because in fact, my father is an Arab.” And that's how you have the narration of Suhaib  telling his story about how they were an Arab family amongst the Persians.
His father became a governor on behalf of Kisra, and then he was kidnapped by the Romans, and then he made his way back to the Arabs.
And  despite his foreignness, both in terms of his appearance and where he came from and his language, the way he spoke, his foreignness and not having a tribe to ascribe himself to that was known to Quraysh, all of that, Umar  still appointed him as the imam of the Muslims as they were deliberating on who the Khalifa would be.
And as he wept and cried heavily, he shouted out, “Oh my brother.” He didn't call out to him and , oh my Khalifa, but the affection that he had for Umar , he , oh my brother, my brother is dying.

--- Conversion and Early Islam ---
Suhaib and Ammar arrived to come and accept Islam at the exact same time.
the Prophet  presented Islam to us and we accepted Islam.
Ammar and Suhaib accepted Islam together at the same time.
He essentially was a Roman when he came to the Prophet  and  the name fit him as Suhaib al-Rumi , as he embraced Islam under those circumstances.
That was something that the Prophet   to me, and  I embraced that name because it was what the Prophet  called me.” And he says, “As for the ascription to the Arabs, it is because in fact, my father is an Arab.” And that's how you have the narration of Suhaib  telling his story about how they were an Arab family amongst the Persians.

--- Persecution ---
Now we know, as we talked about Khabbab and Ammar and Bilal and Sumayya and Yasir, that they were going to be tortured in unique ways.
We know that the powerful, the elite amongst Quraysh, would be tortured privately by the elite of their own tribes.
Meaning anyone could torture Suhaib.
Any one of them could pluck Suhaib from the streets of Mecca and go and torture him for a few days, and no one would  anything to him.
As the narrations tell us in the books of Seerah, Ammar and Suhaib used to be tortured until they would not know what they were saying.
they would be beaten to a point of incoherence.
They'd be tortured, hung out in the sun, whipped, dehydrated, starved, and each one of them would be tortured to a point that they no longer were even aware of their environment.
they would be tortured to a point of being disoriented.
And that's where, by the way, a lot of the mufassiri , this is where the ayah, some  it was revealed after the torture of Bilal, some  it was revealed in this incident, that those who sell themselves for Allah .
When you read Suratul Buruj, and you read about the people of the ditch, the people who were tortured for saying la ilaha illallah and killed by that oppressive king.

--- Hijra ---
Now, the hijrah comes.
And when the time of the hijrah comes, Suhaib  was one of those who was  barred from society.
And he was also barred from the ability to make the hijrah alongside the Prophet .
he , then the time of hijrah came.
And he , when the time of hijrah came, the companions had gone forth.
And when the Prophet  and Abu Bakr  were to make the hijrah, I was supposed to be the third amongst them, but Quraysh blocked me.
he was looking forward to accompanying the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  on that journey of the hijrah, but he was unable to do .
he , Quraysh blocked me, I was locked up, and their intention was to forbid me from doing the hijrah altogether.
Suhaib , every single Muslim had left Mecca, all of those who intended to make the hijrah had left to make the hijrah, except for me.
Suhaib  says, I came to the Prophet , starving from the hijrah.
why is it that you ascribe yourself to the Arab and you are a Roman?” And then he , “You tend to be extravagant in your purchase of food, you purchase a lot of food.” And remember that incident that took place when Suhaib  came to make the hijrah with the Prophet .

--- Battle ---
He's fair game to Quraysh and he's a tempting target because if you attack Suhaib you can take his wealth and  now with the anti-Islamic fervour that's going to grow in the climate in Mecca, the hostility towards the Prophet  and his followers, who's going to stand up for Suhaib in a society where they would have been hesitant to stand up for him in the first place?
They'd be tortured, hung out in the sun, whipped, dehydrated, starved, and each one of them would be tortured to a point that they no longer were even aware of their environment.
Suhaib has his wealth somewhere that Quraysh is unaware of, hidden.
he was looking forward to accompanying the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  on that journey of the hijrah, but he was unable to do .
By the time they realized it, I was already advanced, somewhat to the outskirts of Mecca.”  he , “They caught up with me, and I was on top of a hill, and I saw them coming at me, and I  to them, “Listen, Oh Quraysh,  that I am amongst the most skilled archers amongst you, and he's pointing his arrows towards them.
And as Suhaib is getting there, he sees the Prophet  and the Prophet  sees Suhaib coming forward with none of his wealth, all by himself, looking sick.
I'm not promising you victory in battle.
Now, as he goes forward, and some of the narrations  he arrived at Quba at the same time as Ali .
After he took on the task of sleeping in the bed of the Prophet , discharging the trust of the Prophet  to the people of Mecca, then Ali  made his way to Medina by foot, and came to Quba, and his feet were full of blisters, and wounds, because he had to make that journey without any horse or any camel.
in Medina, Suhaib  says that there was not a single battle of the Prophet , except that I was by his side, I was in front of him, I was behind him, to his left, or to his .
And I want to  fast forward to the conquest of Makkah.
Remember when we spoke about Bilal , we  that there was a comment that was made to Abu Sufyan that verily the swords of Allah did not reach the neck of the enemy of Allah as they should have.
Another famous hadith that's narrated from Suhaib  that the Prophet  recited the verse, “That for those who have done good is ihsan, for those who have put forth excellence is an excellent reward in return and even more.” And the Prophet  , “When the people of Jannah enter into Jannah and the people of fire enter into the fire, a caller will cry out and , O people of paradise, you have a covenant with Allah  that he wishes to fulfill.

--- Virtue(s) ---
Welcome back to the first.
tonight, we're going to be talking about the last of the first seven to show their Islam publicly according to the narrations that we have cited when speaking about Bilal and Khabbab and Ammar.
if things are to go wrong, if there's any type of instability, Suhaib would be the first one to have his wealth taken away from him because he is not protected the way that many of the others are protected.
He's fair game to Quraysh and he's a tempting target because if you attack Suhaib you can take his wealth and  now with the anti-Islamic fervour that's going to grow in the climate in Mecca, the hostility towards the Prophet  and his followers, who's going to stand up for Suhaib in a society where they would have been hesitant to stand up for him in the first place?
they have this relationship, Umar  and Suhaib  and it shows in the virtue of Suhaib as well.
Number one, it speaks to the virtue of Suhaib, ?
that's one of the great virtues of Suhaib , and it speaks to the culture in Islam that was created, that Umar , of course, who we saw was completely transformed by Islam.
And what an honor that Suhaib  was  the one who jumped into the grave of Umar bin Khattab  and received his body to place it alongside the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq .
And that speaks to, , that in and of itself was an incredible honor that Allah  bestowed on Suhaib al-Rumi .
But Allah , may Allah be pleased with him for the wonderful personality and the journey of this man who is again, one of the first seven to publicize his Islam, the last of whom we are covering in this series.

--- Death ---
He spoke Arabic, but he always had a Roman accent, even when he passed away.
By the time they realized it, I was already advanced, somewhat to the outskirts of Mecca.”  he , “They caught up with me, and I was on top of a hill, and I saw them coming at me, and I  to them, “Listen, Oh Quraysh,  that I am amongst the most skilled archers amongst you, and he's pointing his arrows towards them.
When you read Suratul Buruj, and you read about the people of the ditch, the people who were tortured for saying la ilaha illallah and killed by that oppressive king.
