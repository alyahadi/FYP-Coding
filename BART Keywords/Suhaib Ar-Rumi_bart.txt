--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
Suhaib al-Rumi was kidnapped as a five year old from the Persian Empire. He was taken back with the Byzantines, separated from his mother in the slave markets. Suhaib escaped to Mecca, but was disregarded by the people of Mecca, even though he was an Arab.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
Ammar and Suhaib accepted Islam together at the same time. He essentially was a Roman when he came to the Prophet. The name fit him as he embraced Islam under those circumstances. He says, “As for the ascription to the Arabs, it is because in fact, my father is an Arab”

--- Persecution Summary ---
We know that the powerful, the elite amongst Quraysh, would be tortured privately by the elite of their own tribes. Any one of them could pluck Suhaib from the streets and torture him for a few days, and no one would do anything to him.

--- Hijra Summary ---
Suhaib was one of those who was barred from society. He was looking forward to accompanying the Prophet and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq on that journey of the hijrah. But he was unable to do so because he was locked up by Quraysh.

--- Battle Summary ---
Suhaib was looking forward to accompanying the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq on that journey of the hijrah, but he was unable to do. He's fair game to Quraysh and he's a tempting target because if you attack Suhaib you can take his wealth and now with the anti-Islamic fervour that's going to grow in the climate in Mecca, the hostility towards the Prophet.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
Suhaib al-Rumi is one of the last of the first seven to show their Islam publicly according to the narrations. He jumped into the grave of Umar bin Khattab to place his body alongside the Prophet and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq. Suhaib's virtue speaks to the culture in Islam that was created.

--- Death Summary ---
He spoke Arabic, but he always had a Roman accent, even when he passed away. By the time they realized it, I was already advanced, somewhat to the outskirts of Mecca. “Listen, Oh Quraysh,  that I am amongst the most skilled archers amongst you, and he's pointing his arrows towards them”
