--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
As we mentioned, when he became Muslim, his mother argued with him. His mother did not  that, and Zubayr  was going to be tortured by the same uncle who told Safiyyah that she was too rough on him before. And this uncle was Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, and I believe it was a few years ago that I  gave a khutbah about him because he was a fascinating character to me.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
They  that he embraced Islam  away with Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  and he is inseparable from Talha ibn Ubaidullah , who we'll talk about after Asma . And the youth, they're only 12 or 13 years old each as they're coming to embrace Islam, and they listen to the da'wah of Abu Bakr, and immediately they're convinced. When Zubayr embraced Islam, he lost all of his friends with the exception of Talha and Ali, as well, who were close to his age and also his first cousin because of Abu Talib.

--- Persecution Summary ---
His mother did not  that, and Zubayr  was going to be tortured by the same uncle who told Safiyyah that she was too rough on him before. You don't hear the Prophet  talk much about him but he was  fierce in his persecution of the Prophet  and the things that he would  to the Prophet  and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet  that the Prophet  nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh. Zubayr  was going to be tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid which was known at the time especially with the early converts before the open persecution of people that people would be tortured by their own families.

--- Hijra Summary ---
he came back to Mecca prior to the migration to Medina and he marries Asma’, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr  wanted his daughters to be married to those who were struggling in the path of Allah . Asma’  made the hijrah while she was very late in her pregnancy, and obviously Asma’ played a role in the hijrah of the Prophet , which we'll talk about. She was not just tasked with traveling from Mecca to Medina, but she also plays a role in assisting the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  in the migration of the Prophet , all while she was very pregnant.

--- Battle Summary ---
And it was deeply hurtful to the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah  did not want to come face to face with him in the battle of Badr. But the Prophet  was sitting one day and as he is sitting, Zubayr , this young man who is facing the torture of his life comes running towards the Prophet  breathing heavily and he's holding his sword. And he arrives at the Prophet  panting, holding his sword and then he catches his breath, and the Prophet  says, “What's wrong with you?

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
The type of strength that she was imparting upon Zubayr  and hoping that he would grow up with, and of course he would grow up with that strength and exceed all of the expectations of that strength and that courage and that intelligence and that nobility and that honour. And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet  who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet . He's the first cousin of the Prophet  because of his mother, Safiyyah, and of course his father was the brother of Khadijah .

--- Death Summary ---
He heard that the Prophet  was attacked, and he went forth to defend the Prophet   away, not thinking about the consequences of which would have surely been that he would be killed. That they met at the Nile River for a battle and obviously the Muslims had to stay out of it and Najashi had privately given to Ja'far and Uthman and the Muslims a ship, and given them a contingency plan in case he himself was going to be killed. Asma’ and Zubayr arrive in Medina, and obviously when you read about the hijrah to Medina and you read about the way that the Muslims who came from Mecca felt, they felt  Medina was death.
