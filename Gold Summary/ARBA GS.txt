Family or Lineage Overview
Born as Abdu Amr or Abdul Ka'bah, his name was changed by the Prophet to Abdurrahman, one of the most beloved names to Allah. He was from Banu Zuhra, the same tribe as Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas (RA) and Amina bint Wahb, the mother of the Prophet ﷺ. His mother was Ash-Shifa, from the children of Abd ibn Harith. He had multiple marriages which connected him to several powerful tribes within Quraysh. His nickname was Abu Muhammad.

Conversion and Early Islam
Among the earliest converts to Islam within the first 10-15 people through Abu Bakr (RA). Accepted Islam before Dar al-Arqam and studied there. Met a Christian monk in Yemen during a trade trip who told him of the coming Prophet. He returned to Mecca and embraced Islam after confirmation from Abu Bakr. His conversion reflects early recognition and dedication to the Prophet.

Persecution
Faced persecution in Mecca for his faith. Participated in the first migration to Abyssinia and later returned to Mecca before making the Hijrah to Medina.

Hijrah
One of the few Sahabah to make two Hijrahs to Abyssinia and then to Medina. In Medina, he was paired with Sa’ad ibn Rabee’ from the Ansar. Sa’ad offered half his wealth and family, but Abdurrahman declined and asked to be shown the marketplace, where he independently built a successful business from scratch.

Battle
Participated in all major battles with the Prophet, including Badr and Uhud. Suffered over 20 wounds in Uhud, leaving him with a lifelong limp. Captured Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who was later killed by Bilal (RA), his brother-in-law. Donated generously for military campaigns, notably contributing 2,000 dinars and up to 200 pounds of gold for expeditions. Led military expeditions and was personally prepared and wrapped with a turban by the Prophet ﷺ, who advised him on taqwa and strategic marriage to the daughter of a tribal chief, resulting in the birth of the renowned scholar Abu Salama.

Virtue
Known for immense generosity. Paid off debts for a third of Medina. Forgave debts owed to him. Gave sadaqah to another third. The only person confirmed to have led the Prophet in prayer (in Tabuk), with the Prophet joining the jama'ah mid-prayer. Supported the wives of the Prophet ﷺ financially and accompanied them on Hajj. Sold land for 40,000 dinars, distributing it to Banu Zuhra, the poor, and the Prophet’s wives. Known for extreme humility and asceticism despite wealth. He feared being consumed by dunya and regularly made dua against greed. Reported hadiths related to jizya and plague protocol. Was trusted with shura by both Abu Bakr and Umar (RA) and was instrumental in selecting Uthman (RA) as Khalifah. Declined the caliphate, praying to die before being tested with it—a prayer that was answered.

Death
Passed away at around age 75, due to natural causes, before the fitnah of Uthman’s assassination. Freed hundreds of slaves and distributed massive wealth in his will. Gave 400 dinars each to surviving veterans of Badr. Gave large amounts to the Prophet’s wives and family. Described by Ali (RA) as one who attained worldly goodness without being deluded by it. His janazah was attended by nearly the entire ummah of Medina. Buried with a legacy of righteousness, humility, and abundant sadaqah.
