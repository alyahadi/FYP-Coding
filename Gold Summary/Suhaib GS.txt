Family or Lineage Overview
Suhaib ibn Sinan ibn Malik, better known as Suhaib al-Rumi (Suhaib the Roman), was an ethnically Arab companion of the Prophet SAW. He earned the nickname “al-Rumi” due to his fair skin, blond hair, and foreign accent, which led many to mistakenly assume he was of Roman origin. In reality, Suhaib was born in the Persian Empire, where his father served as governor of the city of Al-Ubulla (modern-day Basra) under the Persian emperor Kisra. At the age of five, Suhaib was captured during a Roman raid and sold into slavery, spending two decades as a servant in Byzantine lands. Eventually, he escaped and made his way to Mecca.

Conversion and Early Islam
He came to Mecca and was either bought or protected by Abdullah ibn Jad’an, the wealthiest man in Mecca. Learned trade, became a wealthy merchant, and was accepted among the Arabs despite being seen as foreign. Met the Prophet SAW either through trade or during Hilf al-Fudul in Ibn Jad’an’s house. Along with Ammar ibn Yasir, they accepted Islam together at Dar al-Arqam, after seeking out the Prophet SAW. Suhaib was among the first seven to publicly proclaim Islam, alongside Bilal, Khabbab, and others.

Persecution
After embracing Islam, he was targeted by Quraysh due to having no tribal protection. Even though he was wealthy, he was vulnerable. He was brutally tortured, like Ammar and Bilal, to the point of mental disorientation. Considered among the “weakened ones” whom Quraysh demanded the Prophet SAW abandon.

Hijrah
Barred from leaving Mecca by Quraysh and placed under constant surveillance. Hid his wealth and pretended to be sick to trick his guards. Escaped Mecca and was pursued by Quraysh. He bartered his freedom by offering them the locations of all his hidden wealth. The Prophet SAW received him with the words, “Profitable was your transaction, O Abu Yahya!”. This was in reference to his sacrifice of wealth for the sake of Islam. 

Battle
Participated in all battles with the Prophet SAW, always by his side. Played a supportive and loyal military role despite his previous enslavement and physical toll from torture.

Virtue
Known for his sharp wit, charisma, and humor, which made him beloved to the Prophet SAW and his companions. Appointed by Umar to lead the prayers for the Muslims after Umar’s assassination until a new Khalifa was chosen. This indicates Suhaib’s high standing, despite his accent and foreign upbringing. Suhaib was one of the pallbearers of Umar and lowered him into the grave alongside Abu Bakr and the Prophet SAW.

Death
Suhaib lived into the early caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan, eventually withdrawing from public life to avoid the emerging internal conflicts among Muslims. Despite his early status and immense sacrifices, he died relatively unknown, having chosen a life of quietude and seclusion. He was survived by a few children and was married to Rayta bint Abi Umayyah.
