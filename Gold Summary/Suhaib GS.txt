Family or Lineage Overview
Full name: Suhaib ibn Sinan ibn Malik.

Nicknamed "Suhaib al-Rumi" (Suhaib the Roman) due to his appearance and upbringing among the Byzantines.

Ethnically Arab, though he was mistakenly thought to be Roman due to:

Fair skin and blonde hair

Speaking Arabic with a foreign (Greek) accent

Born in the Persian Empire, where his father was appointed governor of a city named Al-Ubulla (now part of Basra) by Kisra (Persian emperor).

Kidnapped at age five during a Roman raid and sold into slavery in the Byzantine (Roman) Empire.

Spent 20 years in Roman lands as a slave, eventually escaping to Mecca.

Conversion and Early Islam
Came to Mecca and was either bought or protected by Abdullah ibn Jad’an, the wealthiest man in Mecca.

Learned trade, became a wealthy merchant, and was accepted among the Arabs despite being seen as foreign.

Met the Prophet ﷺ either through trade or during Hilf al-Fudul in Ibn Jad’an’s house.

Along with Ammar ibn Yasir (RA), accepted Islam together at Dar al-Arqam, after seeking out the Prophet ﷺ.

Suhaib was among the first seven to publicly proclaim Islam, alongside Bilal, Khabbab, and others.

Persecution
After embracing Islam, he was targeted by Quraysh due to having no tribal protection.

Wealthy but vulnerable, he was seen as fair game for torture by any of the elites.

Was brutally tortured, like Ammar and Bilal, to the point of mental disorientation.

Considered among the “weakened ones” whom Quraysh demanded the Prophet ﷺ abandon.

Hijrah (Migration to Medina)
Barred from leaving Mecca by Quraysh and placed under constant surveillance.

Hid his wealth and pretended to be sick to trick his guards.

Escaped Mecca and was pursued by Quraysh. He bartered his freedom by offering them the locations of all his hidden wealth.

The Prophet ﷺ received him with the words:
“Profitable was your transaction, O Abu Yahya!”

This was in reference to his sacrifice of wealth for the sake of Islam.

Possibly arrived in Quba at the same time as Ali (RA), both exhausted from the journey.

Battle
Participated in all battles with the Prophet ﷺ, always by his side.

Played a supportive and loyal military role despite his previous enslavement and physical toll from torture.

Virtue
Known for his sharp wit, charisma, and humor, which made him beloved to the Prophet ﷺ and companions.

Had a strong friendship with Umar ibn Al-Khattab (RA):

Umar joked about his nickname and foreignness.

Suhaib replied that the Prophet ﷺ himself gave him the nickname Abu Yahya.

Appointed by Umar (RA) to lead the prayers for the Muslims after Umar’s assassination until a new Khalifa was chosen.

This indicates Suhaib’s high standing, despite his accent and foreign upbringing.

Suhaib was one of the pallbearers of Umar (RA) and lowered him into the grave alongside Abu Bakr and the Prophet ﷺ.

Narrated the famous hadith of resilience and gratitude:

“How wonderful is the affair of the believer... If good comes, he is grateful. If hardship comes, he is patient…”

Also narrated:

Hadith about gazing at Allah in Jannah (from Surah Yunus).

Long hadith of Ashab al-Ukhdood (People of the Ditch) from Surah Al-Buruj.

Death
Lived into the early caliphate of Uthman (RA).

Avoided the internal conflicts (fitna) among Muslims and retreated to a quiet life.

Died relatively unknown, despite his massive sacrifices and early status.

Survived by a few children, married to Rayta bint Abi Umayyah.

Left behind a legacy of patience, sacrifice, and sincerity.
