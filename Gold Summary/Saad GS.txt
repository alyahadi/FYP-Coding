Conversion and Early Islam

He accepted Islam through Abu Bakr, as did several of the ten promised Paradise. Remained unmarried and lived with his mother at the time of his conversion.

Persecution
Faced emotional torture from his mother, who disapproved of his conversion. She refused to eat, drink, or groom herself, hoping to guilt him into leaving Islam. Saad remained firm, telling her that even if she had 100 souls, he would not leave his faith.
