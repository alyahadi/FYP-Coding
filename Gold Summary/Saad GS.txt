Family or Lineage Overview
Full name: Saad ibn Abi Waqqas ibn Wahab.

Tribe: Banu Zuhrah, a respected clan in Quraysh.

Related to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through Amina bint Wahab (Prophet’s mother) – making him the maternal uncle of the Prophet ﷺ in lineage.

Though referred to as an "uncle," Saad (RA) was actually about 20 years younger than the Prophet ﷺ.

Known by the kunya Abu Ishaq.

Described as short, dark-skinned, lion-like in appearance, and had a hairy, strong build.

Profession: Maker of bows and arrows, and a master archer.

Conversion and Early Islam
Converted to Islam as a teenager, around 17 years old.

Among the first 7-10 people to accept Islam.

His dream before conversion: saw a full moon and followed it, finding Zayd ibn Harithah, Abu Bakr, and Ali in the dream — all of whom had already accepted Islam.

Accepted Islam through Abu Bakr (RA), as did several of the ten promised Paradise.

Remained unmarried and lived with his mother at the time of his conversion.

Persecution
Faced emotional torture from his mother, who disapproved of his conversion.

She refused to eat, drink, or groom herself, hoping to guilt him into leaving Islam.

Saad (RA) remained firm, telling her that even if she had 100 souls, he would not leave his faith.

Quranic verses (Surah Luqman and Surah Al-Ahqaf) were revealed, commanding excellence to parents, even when they oppose Islam, but not to obey them in disobedience to Allah.

This incident illustrated a new form of persecution – emotional manipulation from loved ones.

Hijrah
Migrated to Medina with the Prophet ﷺ.

Participated in all major events post-Hijrah, remaining a close and trusted companion throughout.

Battle
First to shed blood in defense of Islam when ambushed during early secret prayers.

Known as the first to shoot an arrow in the cause of Islam.

Battle of Badr: Fought bravely, his younger brother Umair (RA) became one of the few martyrs of Badr.

Battle of Uhud:

Distinguished as the greatest archer, protecting the Prophet ﷺ throughout the battle.

The Prophet ﷺ handed him arrows and said:
“Shoot, O Saad! May my mother and father be sacrificed for you.”

This dua was never made for anyone else.

Fought in all other major battles and later led the Muslims in the conquest of Persia, including the Battle of Qadisiyyah and the conquest of the palace of Kisra (Persian emperor).

Virtue
One of the Ashara Mubashshara – ten companions promised Paradise by name.

The Prophet ﷺ prayed for him, saying:
“O Allah, direct Saad’s aim and respond to his supplications.”

As a result, his duas were accepted, and people feared his supplications, especially when wronged.

Narrated the hadith about inheritance limits – the one-third rule came from his request to donate while sick.

Known for generosity, charity, and obedience to Allah.

Maintained political neutrality during the internal conflicts post-Prophet ﷺ.

Avoided fitnah and violence.

Preferred to live in obscurity, self-sufficiently, and focused on da’wah (even to China).

Narrated many prophetic sayings about avoiding internal conflict and prioritizing righteousness and obscurity.

Death
Lived a long life and was the last of the ten promised Paradise to pass away.

Died during the reign of Mu’awiyah (RA).

Buried in Al-Baqi in Medina.

Before his death, he lived peacefully in the mountains, tending to sheep and crops, avoiding political involvement.

Left behind over 20 children, having lived decades after first embracing Islam.

Prophet ﷺ’s dua for his long life and answered supplications was clearly fulfilled.
