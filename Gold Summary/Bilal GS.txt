Family or Lineage Overview
Full name: Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi. Mother: Hamama, an Abyssinian princess captured during Abrahah’s failed invasion of Mecca (Year of the Elephant). Father: Rabah, a Black Arab slave. Born into slavery in Mecca around 580 CE, about 10 years younger than the Prophet ﷺ. Known for his dark skin, handsome appearance, hazel eyes, and youthful look throughout his life. Had no known children but was affectionately called Abu Abdillah.

Conversion and Early Islam
Converted early in Islam, likely influenced by hearing Umayyah ibn Khalaf (his master) complain about the Prophet ﷺ. One of the first seven to publicly declare Islam. Instantly connected to Tawheed (monotheism), often repeated “Ahadun Ahad” (One, One) under torture. Embraced Islam before hearing much of its theology—drawn to its message of divine unity and human equality. Was closely associated with other early oppressed converts like Khabbab, Suhayb, Ammar, and Sumayyah.

Persecution
Severely tortured by Umayyah ibn Khalaf to renounce Islam. Faced: Whipping, starvation, and dehydration. Dragged through streets and assaulted by mobs. Heavy stone placed on his chest under scorching sun. Continually responded with “Ahadun Ahad”, refusing to renounce monotheism. Eventually freed by Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (RA), who paid a high price for his freedom.

Hijrah
Participated in the Hijrah to Medina. In Medina, became: The first official mu’adhin (caller to prayer). The treasurer and close personal attendant of the Prophet ﷺ. One of the Prophet’s closest companions, always by his side in journeys, camps, and battles.

Battle
Fought in every major battle with the Prophet ﷺ, including Badr, Uhud, and Khandaq. At Badr, confronted his former master Umayyah ibn Khalaf, ultimately killing him in a moment of personal and moral justice. Participated in the Fath Makkah (Conquest of Mecca): Entered the Ka'bah with the Prophet ﷺ. Called the Adhan from on top of the Ka'bah, symbolizing the triumph of monotheism and justice over tribalism and slavery.

Virtue
Known for: Unshakable faith. Being the first mu’adhin in Medina, Mecca, and Jerusalem (Al-Quds). Close service to the Prophet ﷺ, including waking him for prayers and guarding his private time. The Prophet ﷺ once said, “I heard your footsteps in Paradise” and asked Bilal what deed he hoped in most—he replied that he always prayed two rak'ahs after every wudu. Called “our master who was freed by our master” (Abu Bakr) by Umar ibn al-Khattab. Known for being humble, steadfast, and a symbol of spiritual elevation, not because of background, but because of faith and sacrifice. The Prophet ﷺ said he would lead the mu’adhins on the Day of Judgment and that they would have the longest necks (signifying honor and status).

Death
After the Prophet’s ﷺ passing, could not bear to call the Adhan again—he broke down when reaching “Ash-hadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah”. Moved out of Medina to Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), participating in campaigns and helping in the expansion of the Muslim state. Refused to call the Adhan again until Umar (RA) requested it at the conquest of Jerusalem, where Bilal called the Adhan and made the companions weep in remembrance. Passed away in 639 CE (18 AH), likely during the plague of Amwas, longing to reunite with the Prophet ﷺ. His final words reflected this longing:
“Tomorrow, I meet my beloved ones—Muhammad and his companions.”
