ABU UBAIDAH
"Lineage Overview": "called", "name", "lineage", "tribe", "family", "cousin", "uncle", "sister", "mother", "father", "born", "Banu"

There are three reasons that scholars mentioned for the potential of skipping his father's name when we call him the son of al-Jarrah. One of them is that his grandfather played more of a fatherly role in his life. One of the commonly mentioned narrations that we find is that his own father was after him in battle and wanted to sacrifice him. He also has a brother by the name of Yazid, who did convert to Islam and is considered a sahabi, but we don't have much information about him at all. His mother’s name was Umayma, but her lineage is disputed and according to Ibn Hajar, she is  considered one who accepted Islam.
"Conversion and Early Islam": "conversion", "embrace", "accept"

He was a teenager, 18 or 19 years old, and he's considered one of the first ten people to accept Islam. He accepted Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq. He is amongst the first group that were given da'wah by Abu Bakr, and he immediately accompanies the Prophet  and becomes one from the people of Dar al-Arqam.
"Persecution": "persecution", "torture", "beat"

When you're there, imagine the scenes of persecution and imagine the scene of victory. 
There are long years of persecution of the Messenger, where as you're sitting there around the Kaaba, you can look around and you can imagine some of those narrations about the Prophet first being persecuted. Other than that, when it comes to his Meccan life, there isn't much that is talked about at all, except that he was tortured and he was patient. Some of the writers mention that he was tortured by his father severely to the point he was almost killed. Some of them said that one of the reasons why there's such silence on him in Meccan seerah, which generally is not covered as much as the seerah in Medina, is because he went into hiding because of the severity of the persecution.
"Hijra": "migration", "Ansar", "Muhajireen", "Medina", "hijrah", "Abyssinia"

Al-Dhahabi says if he indeed made that migration, that it wasn't for long. He went to Abyssinia; he gained the reward of making hijrah to Abyssinia because there's a reward in hijrah, and he returned to Mecca for some time until he made hijrah to Medina as well. And his brother from the Ansar when he made hijrah was the great Mu'adh ibn Jabal. He gained one of the great distinctions amongst the companions was to be from amongst those that made the two migrations.
"Battle": "battle", "fight", "mission", "war", "sword", "horse", "Badr", "Uhud", "Yarmouk", "Tabuk", "Mu'tah", "Khaybar", "Khandaq"

He’d fight alongside the Prophet SAW in every battle. In every battle that he fought in, he held some position as a general holding a banner, leading alongside the Prophet SAW. Even after the death of the Prophet SAW, Abu Ubaidah RA was always in some capacity, a general in the army. He's extremely skilled in battle, he could track armies; he had certain skill sets that others did not have. In Badr, his father was after him and he was avoiding his father throughout the battle, but eventually his father ambushed him. He had a singular mission in Badr, which was to kill his son, and Abu Ubaidah, instead defending himself, had to kill his father. Damascus was conquered at the same time by Abu Ubaidah and Khalid.
"Virtue(s)": "brave", "courage", "generous", "honor", "virtue", "the first"

He was a teenager, 18 or 19 years old, and he's considered one of the first ten people to accept Islam. And he is also one of the first to memorize the Quran. The Prophet himself praised him and that put him in a certain light with the rest of the companions of the Prophet. 
Abu Ubaidah was one of those that made the first two hijras and his reputation in battle was good. The Prophet Muhammad says that the he is the trustworthy of this ummah.
"Death": "death", "martyr", "shaheed", "killed", "dies", "passed away", "Amwas", "plague"

Abu Ubaidah had come to meet Umar outside of greater Syria, and as they were meeting outside of ash-sham on the border, the news came to them that the plague had struck and that people were dying  and left. The plague started to ravage more people and Umar was worried about some of his sahaba including Abu Ubaidah. Abu Ubaidah said let me stay with my army and I'm pleased with the decree of Allah, and if I die in this plague, then it is shahada. Abu Ubaidah is the one who narrates the famous hadith that if a person dies from a plague, that they're a martyr. Abu Ubaidah takes his camel, starts to look for a place, and then he also struck by the plague and the people rushed to their leader, to Abu Ubaidah, who is the head of them all, he's the leader of Ash-Sham. And as they surround him and he's dying, he says to them that, “Indeed, Allah  has written upon the child of Adam death. And when he dies, the people weep over the death of their leader of Abu Ubaidah al-Jarrah.


 
ARBA
"Lineage Overview": "called", "name", "lineage", "tribe", "family", "cousin", "uncle", "sister", "mother", "father", "born", "Banu"

First and foremost, before Islam his name was not Abdurrahman but it was Abdu Amr or Abdul Ka'ba. 
he is also from the tribe of Banu Zuhra
His mother her name is Ash-Shifa, and we don't have much about her.
And if Allah  gives you victory, then propose to the daughter of the chief of the tribe.” This was a very specific advice that the Prophet  gave to him,, and of course this was a way of softening the hearts of tribes that were hostile and bringing people together.
Abdurahman ibn Auf did what he was told and he married the daughter of the chief of the tribe and through that marriage, his most prominent son was born, and that was Abu Salama ibn Abdurahman ibn Auf, who would go on to become one of the seven jurists of Medina who were famous.
"Conversion and Early Islam": "conversion", "embrace", "accept"

he is one of those who accepted Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq .
Abdurrahman Ibn Auf is again one of the first 10 or 15 to accept Islam before Dar al-Arqam, and who would know the Prophet  before the Prophet  would formally start to gather the people and teach them.
of the rulings of accepting jizya from the Zoroastrians was also taken from Abdurrahman ibn Auf
"Persecution": "persecution", "torture", "beat"

He was the one that took as a prisoner, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who of course used to torture Bilal  and Bilal  was the one who killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf. 
"Hijra": "migration", "Ansar", "Muhajireen", "Medina", "hijrah", "Abyssinia"

He stayed under the radar in Mecca, but he was persecuted, and we see that Abdurrahman Ibn Auf was one of those who made the first migration to Abyssinia and then came back, and he stayed back in Mecca until the migration to Al-Madinah.
he also becomes one of those who have the distinction of being from the people of the two Hijras, the people who migrated twice for the sake of Allah SWT
"Battle": "battle", "fight", "mission", "war", "sword", "horse", "Badr", "Uhud", "Yarmouk", "Tabuk", "Mu'tah", "Khaybar", "Khandaq"

we find that he participated in every battle with the Prophet
suffered over 20 wounds on the day of Uhud. And some of them were so severe in his leg that he would limp for the rest of his life because of the wounds
giving half of your wealth for an expedition is pretty significant and this is something that he constantly would do with the Prophet SAW in multiple expeditions
the Prophet SAW actually appointed him to lead one of those missions, took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself, he made dua for him, advised him to have taqwa
if Allah SWT gives you victory, then propose to the daughter of the chief of the tribe
"Virtue(s)": "brave", "courage", "generous", "honor", "virtue", "the first"

the companions spoke about this man that was so generous with his wealth and generous with his heart and generous with his spirit
everyone in Medina was somehow living off the sadaqa of this man and the only one that would beat him at times was again Uthman ibn Affan RA. 
if you are generous and grateful that you will have that position with Allah and with the Messenger SAW
In Tabuk, Prophet SAW was nowhere to be found and the companions doesn’t want to risk the timing of the salah, so they appointed Abdurrahman bin Auf to lead the salah, which tells you about his position in the first place.
Abdurrahman bin Auf being the first of the muhajireen that we know those that migrated from Mecca to have a wedding in Medina and he did it all by himself, meaning he did not take up the generous offer of his sponsor. extremely wealthy and smart and really self-sufficient in the sense like he did not want anyone to do anything for him
"Death": "death", "martyr", "shaheed", "killed", "dies", "passed away", "Amwas", "plague"

Abdurrahman ibn Auf played an important role in the community after the death of the Prophet
he was the one who solved the discussion about how Muslims should act in the case of a plague
Uthman  once became sick, and he wrote in his will that if he passed away in this illness that Abdurrahman ibn Auf would be his successor.
And he , “Oh Allah, if it is indeed that Uthman  has entrusted me with this matter, let me die before he dies.”  that's powerful, ?
he immediately , “Oh Allah, if that's the case, if I'm going to be his successor, let me die before he dies.
I don't want to be tested with that responsibility.” 
he passed away due to natural causes before the fitnah would break out.
he had this dream the night before he passed away and, in his dream, he looks behind him and the entire ummah is behind him.
Ali ibn Abi Talib  describes the scene of his janaza. Ali  looking out at the janaza of Abdurrahman ibn Auf , he  those words, he , “What a sign,  this is Jannah being mandatory for him.” 
Abdurrahman ibn Auf  passed away at the age of about 75 years old and before he died, he liberated, they , hundreds or even thousands of slaves.

Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud  that when they were put in the iron chains and tortured most severely, the only one who would never show his pain was Bilal.
he has Bilal tied to the hot surface in the desert.

Family or Lineage Overview
His full name is Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi. His mother, Hamama, was an Abyssinian princess captured during Abrahah’s failed invasion of Mecca. His father, Rabah, was a Black Arab slave. Born into slavery in Mecca, about 10 years younger than the Prophet SAW. Known for his dark skin, handsome appearance, hazel eyes, and youthful look throughout his life. Had no known children but was called Abu Abdillah.

Conversion and Early Islam
Converted early in Islam, likely influenced by hearing Umayyah ibn Khalaf complain about the Prophet SAW. One of the first seven to publicly declare Islam. Instantly connected to Tawheed (monotheism), often repeated “Ahadun Ahad” under torture. Embraced Islam before hearing much of its theology, drawn to its message of divine unity and human equality. He was closely associated with other early oppressed converts like Khabbab, Suhayb, Ammar, and Sumayyah.

Persecution
Severely tortured by Umayyah ibn Khalaf to renounce Islam. He faced whipping, starvation, and dehydration. Dragged through the streets and assaulted by mobs. A heavy stone was placed on his chest under the scorching sun. Continually responded with “Ahadun Ahad”, refusing to renounce monotheism. Eventually freed by Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who paid a high price for his freedom.

Hijrah
Participated in the Hijrah to Medina. In Medina, he became the first mu’adhin. The treasurer and close personal attendant of the Prophet SAW. One of the Prophet’s closest companions, always by his side in journeys, camps, and battles.

Battle
Fought in every major battle with the Prophet SAW, including Badr, Uhud, and Khandaq. At Badr, he killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf. Participated in the Fath Makkah where he entered the Ka'bah with the Prophet SAW and called the Adhan from on top of the Ka'bah, symbolizing the triumph of monotheism and justice over tribalism and slavery.

Virtue
He is known for his unshakeable faith. Being the first mu’adhin in the three holiest places, Medina, Mecca, and Jerusalem. The Prophet SAW once said, “I heard your footsteps in Paradise” and asked Bilal what deed he hoped in most, he replied that he always prayed two rak'ahs after every wudu. He was called “our master who was freed by our master” by Umar ibn al-Khattab. Known for being humble, steadfast, and a symbol of spiritual elevation, not because of background, but because of faith and sacrifice. The Prophet SAW said he would lead the mu’adhins on the Day of Judgment and that they would have the longest necks.

Death
After the Prophet’s SAW passing, he could not bear to call the Adhan again. So he moved out of Medina to Ash-Sham, participating in campaigns and helping in the expansion of the Muslim state. Refused to call the Adhan again until Umar requested it at the conquest of Jerusalem, where Bilal called the Adhan and made the companions weep in remembrance of Fath Makkah and the Prophet SAW. Passed away likely during the plague of Amwas, longing to reunite with the Prophet SAW.
