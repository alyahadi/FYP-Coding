Family or Lineage Overview
His full name is Amir ibn Abdullah ibn al-Jarrah. Known commonly as Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah. Belonged to the Banu al-Harith ibn Fihr, a distant tribe within Quraysh, not politically powerful like Banu Hashim or Banu Umayyah. Possibly referred to by his grandfather’s name due to his grandfather's stronger role, prominence, or possibly because his father was hostile toward Islam. His mother was Umayma, who may have accepted Islam; his brother Yazid also accepted Islam but is rarely mentioned.

Battle of Badr: May have been forced to confront and kill his own father, who was intent on killing him. Battle of Uhud: Pulled helmet fragments from the Prophet’s cheek with his teeth, losing two teeth in the process. This act earned him great praise and caused a beautiful speech impediment. Conquest of Mecca: Led the center division of the army entering Mecca. Known for a famous sea expedition where his group was miraculously sustained by a massive whale, reflecting his leadership during hardship.

Known for asceticism – lived simply despite his high rank. Had no attachment to leadership or politics; accepted positions only when necessary. Renowned for humility, diplomacy, and integrity—never sought power and avoided conflict over leadership roles.

Died during the plague of Amwas in Ash-Sham around the age of 58. Refused to leave his army when Umar (RA) tried to recall him to Medina for safety, choosing to stay and die with his people. Left behind no surviving descendants; was largely detached from family life. Appointed Mu’adh ibn Jabal (RA) as his successor before passing. Eulogized by Umar (RA) as someone he would have confidently appointed as Khalifah had he lived. His simple home and lifestyle moved Umar (RA) to tears. Umar famously said: “The world changed all of us except you, Abu Ubaidah.” Umar also said: “If I had a room full of men like Abu Ubaidah, I’d be satisfied.”
