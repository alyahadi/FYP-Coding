Nicknamed "Tahira" (The Pure) for her noble character, even before Islam. Had a unique name at the time, meaning “premature,” reflecting her early birth and ahead-of-her-time personality.

Conversion and Early Islam
Khadijah was the first person to believe in the Prophet SAW, embracing Islam immediately after he received the first revelation. When the Prophet came home distressed after seeing Jibreel (AS), she comforted him with unwavering support and took him to Waraqah ibn Nawfal. She accepted the message without hesitation, saying, “I believe in you.” Her complete trust and emotional strength laid the foundation for the Prophet’s early mission. She supported him not only spiritually, but also financially and emotionally.

Persecution
Voluntarily participated in the Quraysh boycott despite not being obligated by tribal ties. Endured extreme hunger and hardship, ate leaves and grass, and used her connections to smuggle food. Her health deteriorated due to this sacrifice, eventually leading to her death.

Hijrah
Passed away before the Hijrah to Medina and thus did not witness the formation of the Islamic state. Despite this, her support during the Meccan phase laid the foundation for the success that came after. 

Battle
Did not participate in physical battles, but her support and wealth funded early da’wah efforts. Her indirect contribution supported Muslims in their earliest, most vulnerable battles, spiritually and materially.

Virtue
Described by the Prophet SAW as one of the four greatest women of all time, alongside Maryam, Asiyah, and Fatima. A woman of perfect faith. The first to pray with the Prophet SAW, do tawaf, and make wudu. The first to receive glad tidings of Jannah, salam from Allah and Jibreel. A promise of a palace in Paradise made of pearls, with no noise or fatigue. Known for extreme generosity, feeding the poor, sponsoring marriages, and helping the sick.

Death
Khadijah died at the age of 65, in Ramadan, in the year 620, and they had been married at that point for 25 years. Ammar ibn Yasir says that we feared for the Prophet after her death that he would die soon after, from the amount of grief that he had when she passed away. And even after she passed away, most of the narrations about Khadijah are from Aisha. And she, every day, 13 years after his death,  a day did not pass that he did not mention her. The persecution that led to the death of Khadijah.
