Conversion and Early Islam
First person to accept Islam, before even the Prophet ﷺ fully understood the nature of the revelation.

Her immediate and unwavering belief set the foundation for the Prophet’s early da’wah.

Reassured the Prophet ﷺ during the first revelation with the famous statement:
“Allah would never disgrace you. You uphold ties of kinship, speak only the truth, help the poor and needy, serve your guests, and assist those in distress.”

Brought the Prophet ﷺ to Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who confirmed the revelation.

Played an active role in the early prayers, worship, and private da’wah.

Persecution
Voluntarily participated in the Quraysh boycott despite not being obligated by tribal ties.

Endured extreme hunger and hardship, ate leaves and grass, and used her connections to smuggle food into the ghetto.

Her health deteriorated due to this sacrifice, eventually leading to her death.

Hijrah
Passed away before the Hijrah to Medina, and thus did not witness the formation of the Islamic state.

Despite this, her support during the Meccan phase laid the foundation for the success that came after.

Referred to by the Prophet ﷺ as “the mother of the believers”—the first of the ummah’s spiritual mothers.

Battle
Did not participate in physical battles, but her support and wealth funded early da’wah efforts.

Her indirect contribution supported Muslims in their earliest, most vulnerable battles—spiritually and materially.

One of the four greatest women of all time, alongside Maryam, Asiyah, and Fatima.

Salam from Allah and Jibreel (AS).

A promise of a palace in Paradise made of pearls, with no noise or fatigue.

Known for:

Extreme generosity, feeding the poor, sponsoring marriages, helping the sick.

Great business acumen – her caravans equaled all of Quraysh’s combined.

Humility despite wealth – green pavilion above her home symbolized access for the needy.

Supported the Prophet ﷺ emotionally, financially, and spiritually—the model of a loyal spouse.

Prophet ﷺ said: “Allah blessed me with her love.”
