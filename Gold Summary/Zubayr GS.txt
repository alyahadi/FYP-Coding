Family or Lineage Overview
Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam was from the Quraysh tribe and a cousin of the Prophet Muhammad SAW through his mother, Safiyyah bint Abdul Muttalib. His father, Al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid, was the brother of Khadijah, the Prophet’s first wife. He was raised by his strong and disciplined mother, Safiyyah, who instilled courage and resilience in him from a young age. He married Asma bint Abu Bakr, the daughter of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, and their son was Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr, a prominent companion. His children were named after martyrs and heroes of Islam, reflecting his deep connection to the spirit of sacrifice and bravery.

Conversion and Early Islam
Embraced Islam at a young age, around 12 or 13 years old, making him among the earliest converts. Converted through the influence of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. Became part of a close trio of young Muslims alongside Talha ibn Ubaydullah and Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was the first to draw his sword in defense of the Prophet (SAW) in Mecca upon a false rumor of an attack.

Persecution
Tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, known as the “Shaytan of Quraysh.” Subjected to brutal methods, including being wrapped in a rug, suffocated by fire smoke, and beaten. However, he still refused to renounce Islam despite severe suffering, showing unwavering faith and courage.

Hijrah
Took part in the migration to Abyssinia, establishing ties with the just Christian ruler, Najashi. Played a brave role during a potential coup against Najashi by swimming across the Nile to gather news of the battle. Later migrated to Medina with Asma, who gave birth to their son Abdullah shortly after arrival, the first child born to the Muhajirun in Medina.

Battle
Played a key role in every major battle with the Prophet (SAW). At Badr, he was one of the only two Muslim horsemen. The angels, including Jibreel, emulated his appearance by wearing yellow turbans. At Uhud, he remained by the Prophet’s side when others fled. Killed a powerful Qurayshi warrior and brought back his horse to the Muslims. At Khandaq, he responded multiple times to the Prophet’s call to check on Banu Qurayza. The Prophet (SAW) called him his disciple. Fought bravely in later battles, including Hunayn, Yarmouk, and the conquest of Egypt.

Virtue
One of the ten promised Paradises. Known for extraordinary bravery, physical strength, and battlefield skills (able to control his horse with his legs and wield two swords). Extremely pious and cautious, as he only narrated very few hadiths due to his fear of misquoting the Prophet SAW. Praised by Umar ibn Al-Khattab as equivalent to a thousand men due to his valor. Called the “Disciple” of the Prophet SAW because each Prophet had one, and Az-Zubayr was his.

Death
Initially aligned with Aisha and Talha in seeking justice for Uthman’s murder. But then he remembered a prophecy from the Prophet SAW that he would wrongfully fight Ali, so he withdrew from the fitna. On his way, he was treacherously murdered in prayer by a man named Amr ibn Jarmuz after leaving the battlefield. Ali mourned him deeply and recalled a hadith from the Prophet SAW declaring the killer of Zubayr to be in Hell. Zubayr’s death was considered a major tragedy and a symbol of the tragic fitnah among the Muslims. He died in salah, as did his son Abdullah and his grandson Urwa. Despite his poverty, he left behind immense unpaid debts and unpaid loans he had given; after his death, millions in value were recovered from people who owed him.
