Family or Lineage Overview:

Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam (RA) was from the Quraysh tribe and a cousin of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) through his mother, Safiyyah bint Abdul Muttalib (the Prophet’s paternal aunt).

His father, Al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid, was the brother of Khadijah (RA), the Prophet’s first wife.

He was raised by his strong and disciplined mother, Safiyyah, who instilled courage and resilience in him from a young age.

He married Asma bint Abu Bakr (RA), the daughter of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (RA), and their son was Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr (RA), a prominent companion.

His children were named after martyrs and heroes of Islam, reflecting his deep connection to the spirit of sacrifice and bravery.

Conversion and Early Islam:

Embraced Islam at a young age, around 12 or 13 years old, making him among the earliest converts.

Converted through the influence of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (RA).

Became part of a close trio of young Muslims alongside Talha ibn Ubaydullah and Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA).

Studied under the Prophet (SAW) in Dar Al-Arqam and was a constant companion in the early days of da’wah.

Was the first to draw his sword in defense of the Prophet (SAW) in Mecca upon a false rumor of an attack.

Persecution:

Tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid, known as the “Shaytan of Quraysh.”

Subjected to brutal methods, including being wrapped in a rug, suffocated by fire smoke, and beaten.

Refused to renounce Islam despite severe suffering, showing unwavering faith and courage.

Hijrah (Migration):

Took part in the migration to Abyssinia, establishing ties with the just Christian ruler, Najashi.

Played a brave role during a potential coup against Najashi by swimming across the Nile to gather news of the battle.

Later migrated to Medina with Asma (RA), who gave birth to their son Abdullah shortly after arrival—he was the first child born to the Muhajirun in Medina.

Battle:

Played a key role in every major battle with the Prophet (SAW).

At Badr, one of only two Muslim horsemen; fought heroically, suffering severe wounds. The angels, including Jibreel (AS), emulated his appearance by wearing yellow turbans.

At Uhud, remained by the Prophet’s side when others fled. Killed a powerful Qurayshi warrior and brought back his horse to the Muslims.

At Khandaq, responded multiple times to the Prophet’s call to check on Banu Qurayza. The Prophet (SAW) called him his "Hawari" (disciple)—a unique honor.

Fought bravely in later battles including Hunayn, Yarmouk (where he fought through the entire Roman line and back), and the conquest of Egypt.

Virtue:

One of the ten promised Paradise (Al-Ashara Al-Mubasharun).

Known for extraordinary bravery, physical strength, and battlefield prowess (able to control his horse with his legs and wield two swords).

Extremely pious and cautious—narrated very few hadiths due to his fear of misquoting the Prophet (SAW).

Praised by Umar ibn Al-Khattab as equivalent to a thousand men due to his valor.

Called the “Disciple” of the Prophet (SAW)—each Prophet had one, and Az-Zubayr was his.

Known for sincerity, loyalty, and humility, even with his high rank.

Death:

Initially aligned with Aisha (RA) and Talha (RA) in seeking justice for Uthman (RA)’s murder.

Met Ali (RA) before the Battle of Jamal; upon remembering a prophecy from the Prophet (SAW) that he would wrongfully fight Ali, he withdrew.

Was treacherously murdered in prayer by a man named Amr ibn Jarmuz after leaving the battlefield.

Ali (RA) mourned him deeply and recalled a hadith from the Prophet (SAW) declaring the killer of Zubayr to be in Hell.

Zubayr’s death was considered a major tragedy and symbol of the tragic internal strife (fitnah) among the Muslims.

Died in salah, as did his son Abdullah and his grandson Urwa—an honored death in Islam.

Despite his poverty, left behind immense unpaid debts and unpaid loans he had given; after his death, millions in value were recovered from people who owed him.
