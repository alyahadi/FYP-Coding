Family or Lineage Overview
His full name is Ja'far ibn Abi Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib al-Hashimi. He is the son of Abu Talib and Fatima bint Asad, the first woman from Banu Hashim to accept Islam. He is also the brother of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Looked most like the Prophet SAW in both physical appearance and character. His nickname was Abu Abdillah. Also known as Dhul-Janahain, the one with two wings in Paradise. Married to Asma’ bint Umais, one of the early believing women from the “believing sisters.”

Conversion and Early Islam
Among the first 15 - 20 to accept Islam. Converted with his wife Asma’ bint Umais. Raised by al-Abbas, while Ali was raised by the Prophet SAW to ease Abu Talib’s financial burden. He spent much of his time away from Medina due to his mission in Abyssinia.

Persecution
We knew that they were amongst the family of the Prophet, and they were in that situation, subjected to similar persecution. And that the persecution became severe for Ja'far and Asma’, they sought permission to be amongst those who would go out to Abyssinia.

Hijrah
Led the second batch of Muslims to Abyssinia to escape persecution. Appointed as the leader and spokesman by the Prophet SAW despite his young age. Delivered a historic speech to King Najashi, eloquently explaining Islam and reciting verses from Surah Maryam. His da’wah moved Najashi to tears and led to the first Christian king accepting Islam. Spent around 12 years in Abyssinia, had three sons there. Returned to Medina at the time of Khaybar, after missing Badr, Uhud, and Khandaq.

Battle
Appointed by the Prophet SAW as the second commander in the Battle of Mu’tah, after Zayd ibn Haritha. When Zayd was martyred, Ja'far took command and fought courageously until he lost both arms in battle while continuing to fight until he was finally martyred. He was struck with over 70 wounds. The Prophet SAW later described him as flying in Jannah with two wings, hence his title.

Virtue
Most resembled the Prophet SAW in both appearance and character. Known as the “father of the poor”, deeply loved by the poor, frequently sat with them, and shared whatever he had. Praised by Abu Hurairah as the best man after the Prophet SAW. The Prophet SAW said, “You are the most like me in looks and in character.” His wife, Asma’, was deeply respected, later married Abu Bakr, then Ali, and was involved in caring for both Abu Bakr and Fatima after their deaths.

Death
Martyred at the Battle of Mu’tah, shortly after returning to Medina. The Prophet SAW grieved deeply. Initiated the sunnah of preparing food for a grieving family. Given the glad tidings of Jannah by the Prophet SAW, seen flying among angels with two wings. Legacy preserved through his descendants and the title Dhul-Janahain.
