Family or Lineage Overview
Full name: Ja'far ibn Abi Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib al-Hashimi. Son of Abu Talib (uncle of the Prophet ﷺ) and Fatima bint Asad (first woman from Banu Hashim to accept Islam). Brother of Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA); 10 years older than Ali. Looked most like the Prophet ﷺ in both physical appearance and character. Nicknames: Abu Abdillah (father of Abdullah). Dhul-Janahain (the one with two wings in Paradise). Married to Asma’ bint Umais, one of the early believing women from the “believing sisters.”

Conversion and Early Islam
Among the first 15–20 to accept Islam. Converted with his wife Asma’ bint Umais, reflecting the influence of the Prophet ﷺ’s close family. Raised by al-Abbas, while Ali (RA) was raised by the Prophet ﷺ to ease Abu Talib’s financial burden. Participated in Islam’s formative years, though much of his time was spent away from Medina due to his mission in Abyssinia.

Persecution
Although specifics are limited, Ja'far and Asma’ experienced persecution in Mecca severe enough to warrant migration.This hardship ultimately led them to be part of the first major Islamic emigration.

Hijrah
Led the second batch of Muslims to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to escape persecution. Appointed as the leader and spokesman by the Prophet ﷺ despite his young age. Delivered a historic speech to King Najashi, eloquently explaining Islam and reciting verses from Surah Maryam. His da’wah moved Najashi to tears and led to the first Christian king accepting Islam. Spent around 12 years in Abyssinia, had three sons there: Abdullah, Muhammad, and Aoun. Returned to Medina at the time of Khaybar, after missing Badr, Uhud, and Khandaq.

Battle
Appointed by the Prophet ﷺ as the second commander in the Battle of Mu’tah (after Zayd ibn Haritha). When Zayd was martyred, Ja'far took command and fought courageously against overwhelming odds (Byzantine army). Lost both arms in battle while continuing to fight until he was finally martyred. Struck with over 70 wounds, earning immense honor and recognition. The Prophet ﷺ later described him as flying in Jannah with two wings, hence his title.

Virtue
Most resembled the Prophet ﷺ in both appearance and character. Known as the “father of the poor”, deeply loved by the poor, frequently sat with them and shared whatever he had. Praised by Abu Hurairah (RA) as the best man after the Prophet ﷺ. Humble, generous, and full of empathy—his qualities reflected the Prophet’s teachings. Earned immense praise from the Prophet ﷺ: “You are the most like me in looks and in character.” His wife, Asma’, was deeply respected, later married Abu Bakr, then Ali, and was involved in caring for both Abu Bakr and Fatima after their deaths.

Death
Martyred at the Battle of Mu’tah in 8 AH, shortly after returning to Medina. The Prophet ﷺ grieved deeply, cried upon informing his wife Asma’ and kissed Ja'far’s children. Initiated the sunnah of preparing food for a grieving family. Given the glad tidings of Jannah by the Prophet ﷺ, seen flying among angels with two wings. Legacy preserved through his descendants and the title Dhul-Janahain.
