Family or Lineage Overview
Zayd ibn Harithah was from the Banu Kalb tribe through his father Harithah ibn Sharahil, and his mother, Su'adah bint Tha'laba, was from the Tayy tribe. He was kidnapped as a child during a trip with his mother and sold into slavery by the Banu al-Qayn tribe at Suq al-Uqaz, a slave market. He was later bought by Hakim ibn Hizam and gifted to his aunt, Khadijah (RA), who gave him to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ after their marriage. The Prophet ﷺ treated Zayd like his own son and formally adopted him, giving him the name Zayd ibn Muhammad until adoption laws were changed by divine revelation.

Conversion and Early Islam
Zayd is recognized as the first freed slave (mawla) to accept Islam. While the exact timing of his shahada is debated, he accepted Islam very early, before the public proclamation of prophethood. He remained loyal and deeply attached to the Prophet ﷺ, refusing to return with his biological father when offered the choice.

Persecution
Zayd witnessed the most painful day in the Prophet’s life: Ta’if, where both were violently attacked and humiliated. He tried to shield the Prophet ﷺ from the blows, getting injured himself. He was present during the Prophet’s emotional du'a under the tree after the rejection at Ta’if and witnessed Jibreel (AS) offering divine retribution, which the Prophet ﷺ declined out of mercy.

Hijrah (Migration)
Zayd was entrusted with the care of the Prophet's family during the Hijrah. He accompanied Fatimah, Umm Kulthum, and others during the migration from Mecca to Medina. Once in Medina, the Prophet ﷺ paired Zayd with Hamza (RA) instead of an Ansari, reflecting their close bond.

Battles and Military Role
Zayd participated in all major battles including Badr, Uhud, Khandaq, and Khaybar. He was one of the primary commanders of the Prophet ﷺ and led seven military expeditions, always appointed as commander. Appointed as governor of Medina when the Prophet ﷺ left for expeditions. Married Umm Ayman, a woman whom the Prophet ﷺ described as "my mother after my mother." Together they had Usama ibn Zayd, also deeply beloved by the Prophet ﷺ.

Virtue
Nicknamed "Hibbu Rasulillah" – the beloved of the Prophet ﷺ. Only male companion named in the Qur’an (Surah Al-Ahzab: 37), a unique distinction. Treated like a son by the Prophet ﷺ before and after the prohibition of adoption. Aisha (RA) stated that had Zayd lived, the Prophet ﷺ would have appointed him as Khalifa. Known for nobility, humility, and loyalty, regardless of his past status as a slave. His son Usama was trusted and honored by both the Prophet ﷺ and later by Umar (RA).

Death
Zayd died as a martyr in the Battle of Mu'tah in modern-day Jordan, facing a vastly larger Roman army (200,000 vs. 3,000). Jibreel (AS) informed the Prophet ﷺ of his death before news reached Medina. The Prophet ﷺ publicly mourned Zayd's death from the minbar, weeping for his "beloved son." His legacy lives on through Usama, who was appointed by the Prophet ﷺ to lead the army even after his death, despite his young age.
