--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
Now a lot of the family history of Banu Hashim we covered when we talked about Ali and Fatima, may Allah be pleased with them, but I want to talk about just a little bit once again about the way that Ja'far comes into the picture and reminds everyone who his mother is. We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
And if Ali embraced Islam that early, and then Fatima bint Asad embraced Islam that early, Ja'far is amongst those who embraced Islam very early on with his cousin, the Prophet . And the dates suggest that it was probably just we saw with Sa'eed bin Zayd and Fatima bint al-Khattab, Ja'far and his wife Asma’ bint Umais accepting Islam together.

Now, we don't have much about their life before the migration to Abyssinia, but we do know that they were amongst the family of the Prophet and they were in that situation, subjected to similar persecution. And that the persecution became severe for Ja'far and Asma’, that they sought permission to be amongst those who would go out to Abyssinia.

--- Hijra Summary ---
For him and his companions have only one hijrah and you are the people of two hijrahs.” the Prophet rules in the favour of Asma’, the wife of Ja'far in that sense and says you are the people of two hijrahs. And these were the people that made the two most noble hijrahs, the hijrah to Abyssinia as well as the hijrah to Medina, all for the sake of Allah .
