Talhah fulfilled his obligation, and Jannah became obligated for Talhah, and the Prophet , “Whoever wants to see a walking martyr, a shaheed who still lives, a shaheed who somehow survived, but is still walking on his feet, let him look at Talhah.” , even though Talhah survived that day, the Prophet counted him amongst the shuhada of that day because of the amount of sacrifice that he put forward.
