--- Persecution Summary ---
You don't hear the Prophet talk much about him but he was fierce in his persecution of the Prophet and the things that he would to the Prophet and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet that the Prophet nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh. Zubayr was going to be tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid which was known at the time especially with the early converts before the open persecution of people that people would be tortured by their own families. But the Prophet was sitting one day and as he is sitting, Zubayr , this young man who is facing the torture of his life comes running towards the Prophet breathing heavily and he's holding his sword.

--- Hijra Summary ---
he came back to Mecca prior to the migration to Medina and he marries Asma’, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr wanted his daughters to be married to those who were struggling in the path of Allah . Asma’ and Zubayr arrive in Medina, and obviously when you read about the hijrah to Medina and you read about the way that the Muslims who came from Mecca felt, they felt Medina was death.

--- Battle Summary ---
that's why Zubayr earns that noble title of being the first one to draw his sword in defence of the Prophet in Mecca as the persecution would start to grow of our messenger . He goes to where the battle is taking place and then he comes back, and as they see Zubayr swimming in the Nile to come back, and they're waiting for the news Az-Zubayr chants.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet . One of them of course being the change of environment, the difficulties of the hijrah, and just the rate of fatalities at birth at the time, but Asma’ and Az-Zubayr would be the first to have a child that gave birth to none other than Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr .
