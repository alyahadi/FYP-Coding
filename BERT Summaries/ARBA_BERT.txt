--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
First and foremost, before Islam his name was not Abdurrahman but it was Abdu Amr or Abdul Ka'ba, and we know that the Prophet  used to change the names of those who had names that were contradictory to Islam. , as we know, when those who migrated from Mecca came to Madinah, the Prophet  paired off everyone with a brother from the Ansar, and that brother from the Ansar was to take one of the Muhajireen in and was to care for them and to help them get settled in Al-Madinah. May Allah  bless you in your family and in your wealth.”  Abdurrahman bin Auf being the first of the muhajireen that we know those that migrated from Mecca to have a wedding in Medina and he did it all by himself, meaning he did not take up the generous offer of his sponsor and Sa'ad bin Rabir to take some of his wealth or some of his gardens to be able to do that.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
he had a powerful position, and of course he was extremely wealthy, and he is one of those who accepted Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq . Abdurrahman Ibn Auf is again one of the first 10 or 15 to accept Islam before Dar al-Arqam, and who would know the Prophet  before the Prophet  would formally start to gather the people and teach them. We also find that one of the rulings of accepting jizya from the Zoroastrians was also taken from Abdurrahman ibn Auf, who , “I heard it from the Prophet  and saw it from the Prophet .”  the ruling of jizya from Ahlul Kitab was not specific to Ahlul Kitab, but applied to these other religious communities as well, that they would be protected under the jizya.

--- Persecution Summary ---
he's in a vulnerable situation, being a refugee fleeing persecution in Mecca, and he's with this man whom he doesn't know. He was the one that took as a prisoner, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who of course used to torture Bilal  and Bilal  was the one who killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf. he  everyone in Medina was somehow living off the sadaqa of this man and the only one that would beat him at times was again Uthman ibn Affan .

--- Hijra Summary ---
He stayed under the radar in Mecca, but he was persecuted, and we see that Abdurrahman Ibn Auf was one of those who made the first migration to Abyssinia and then came back, and he stayed back in Mecca until the migration to Al-Madinah. last week we talked about Abu Ubaidah , who only made the second migration to Abyssinia, and this week we talk about Abdurrahman Ibn Auf, who only made the first migration to Abyssinia and came back and spent time with the Prophet  and waited until the order to migrate to Al-Madinah. And we see that the Prophet   appointed him to lead one of those missions, and something significant that happened and this was the fifth year of Hijrah that as the Prophet  was dispatching him, the Prophet  took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself.

--- Battle Summary ---
And we also find that once, as the Prophet  was preparing to dispatch a force, a mission, and Rasulullah  asked for people to sponsor it, that Abdurahman ibn Auf goes home and he brings back 2,000 coins for the Prophet  and Rasulullah  says, “What have you left behind?” He , “O Rasulullah, I give 2,000 for the sake of Allah and I left 2,000 for my family.”  giving half of your wealth for an expedition is pretty significant and this is something that he constantly would do with the Prophet  in multiple expeditions. just think of the scene and as he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf, he put his hand on his head , and he made dua for him and as he made dua for him, he advised him to have taqwa, as the Prophet  would always do when he sends someone out on a military mission. And Khalid  was new to Islam and Khalid   some words to Abdurrahman ibn Auf as they were arguing in the wake of a battle, and the Prophet  was saying to Khalid , “Do not curse my companions or abuse my companions.”  of course, for us, this applies to all of the sahaba of the Prophet , but when the Prophet  spoke to the sahaba, there were of course degrees amongst the sahaba and the Prophet  always gave preference to the firsts and those that came to Islam early on.
