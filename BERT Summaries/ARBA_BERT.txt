--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
First and foremost, before Islam his name was not Abdurrahman but it was Abdu Amr or Abdul Ka'ba, and we know that the Prophet  used to change the names of those who had names that were contradictory to Islam. As far as his tribe is concerned, he is also from the tribe of Banu Zuhra, and we know that this was the tribe of Saad ibn Abi Waqqas , and this was also the tribe of the mother of the Prophet , Amina bint Wahab. it could have been that Abdurrahman ibn Auf was going to be the khalifah of the Muslims and of course Abdurrahman ibn Auf had a very similar personality to Uthman , known for his generosity yet his great modesty and humility and  when the man heard, Hamran was his name, he heard that Uthman  ordered that, he went to Abdurrahman ibn Auf in the masjid, he  “Glad tidings.”

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
he had a powerful position, and of course he was extremely wealthy, and he is one of those who accepted Islam at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq . And he took me to the home of Khadija  that day to embrace Islam. We also find that one of the rulings of accepting jizya from the Zoroastrians was also taken from Abdurrahman ibn Auf, who , “I heard it from the Prophet  and saw it from the Prophet .”

--- Persecution Summary ---
he's in a vulnerable situation, being a refugee fleeing persecution in Mecca, and he's with this man whom he doesn't know. He was the one that took as a prisoner, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who of course used to torture Bilal  and Bilal  was the one who killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf. he  everyone in Medina was somehow living off the sadaqa of this man and the only one that would beat him at times was again Uthman ibn Affan .

--- Hijra Summary ---
He stayed under the radar in Mecca, but he was persecuted, and we see that Abdurrahman Ibn Auf was one of those who made the first migration to Abyssinia and then came back, and he stayed back in Mecca until the migration to Al-Madinah. last week we talked about Abu Ubaidah , who only made the second migration to Abyssinia, and this week we talk about Abdurrahman Ibn Auf, who only made the first migration to Abyssinia and came back and spent time with the Prophet  and waited until the order to migrate to Al-Madinah. And we see that the Prophet   appointed him to lead one of those missions, and something significant that happened and this was the fifth year of Hijrah that as the Prophet  was dispatching him, the Prophet  took a turban and he wrapped the head of Abdurahman ibn Auf himself.

--- Battle Summary ---
Then he worked up enough money  to start trading in horses, and he knew horses from his time in Mecca. Instead we find that he maintained a closeness to the Prophet  in battle just  all of the 10 promised paradise. Meaning only a righteous person will rise to the occasion to take care of the wives of the Prophet  after he passes away, and that was Abdurrahman ibn Auf.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
Abdurrahman Ibn Auf is again one of the first 10 or 15 to accept Islam before Dar al-Arqam, and who would know the Prophet  before the Prophet  would formally start to gather the people and teach them. last week we talked about Abu Ubaidah , who only made the second migration to Abyssinia, and this week we talk about Abdurrahman Ibn Auf, who only made the first migration to Abyssinia and came back and spent time with the Prophet  and waited until the order to migrate to Al-Madinah. There are other narrations about his virtues and they are plentiful and I'll go through some of my favourite and I could literally go all night talking about Abdurrahman ibn Auf, and how the companions spoke about this man that was  generous with his wealth and generous with his heart and generous with his spirit.

--- Death Summary ---
He was the one that took as a prisoner, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who of course used to torture Bilal  and Bilal  was the one who killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf. In the plague of Amwas, he was the one who intervened in the argument between Umar  and Abu Ubaidah , when he , “Are you running away from the decree of Allah  by fleeing from the plague?” , they're all in this illustrious category of being from the 10 that were promised paradise, and one of the narrations is that Uthman  once became sick, and he wrote in his will that if he passed away in this illness that Abdurrahman ibn Auf would be his successor.
