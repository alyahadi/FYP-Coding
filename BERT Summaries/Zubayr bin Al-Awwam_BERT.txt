--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
And this is what I was speaking about in the khutbah, I remember reading about Naufal ibn Khuwaylid the first time and thinking to myself, ‘Ya Allah the brother of Khadija is the shaytan of Quraysh.’ The brother of Khadija , who did everything for the Prophet  who sacrificed her entire life for the Messenger of Allah , and her own brother was the one that would come forth to try to kill the Prophet . When he was born, the Prophet  himself took his saliva and he did the tahniq, he mixed the saliva in the mouth of Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr , and he made dua and they carried Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr  in the streets of Medina and they chanted behind him shouting Allahu Akbar. His cousin, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, the brother of Zainab ibn Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with them was also killed and that's very hurtful to Az-Zubayr  as well, because of how much he loves him and Az-Zubayr  was wounded heavily that day and he's one of the few people that did not flee from the Prophet  on the day of Uhud.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
They  that he embraced Islam  away with Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  and he is inseparable from Talha ibn Ubaidullah , who we'll talk about after Asma . And the youth, they're only 12 or 13 years old each as they're coming to embrace Islam, and they listen to the da'wah of Abu Bakr, and immediately they're convinced. When Zubayr embraced Islam, he lost all of his friends with the exception of Talha and Ali, as well, who were close to his age and also his first cousin because of Abu Talib.

--- Persecution Summary ---
You don't hear the Prophet  talk much about him but he was  fierce in his persecution of the Prophet  and the things that he would  to the Prophet  and then even coming forth on the day of Badr to try to kill the Prophet  that the Prophet  nicknamed him and he was known as the shaytan of Quraysh. Zubayr  was going to be tortured by his uncle Naufal ibn Khuwaylid which was known at the time especially with the early converts before the open persecution of people that people would be tortured by their own families. that's why Zubayr  earns that noble title of being the first one to draw his sword in defence of the Prophet  in Mecca as the persecution would start to grow of our messenger .

--- Hijra Summary ---
he came back to Mecca prior to the migration to Medina and he marries Asma’, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr  wanted his daughters to be married to those who were struggling in the path of Allah . She was not just tasked with traveling from Mecca to Medina, but she also plays a role in assisting the Prophet  and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq  in the migration of the Prophet , all while she was very pregnant. One of them of course being the change of environment, the difficulties of the hijrah, and just the rate of fatalities at birth at the time, but Asma’  and Az-Zubayr would be the first to have a child that gave birth to none other than Abdullah ibn Az-Zubayr .

--- Battle Summary ---
On the other side, there was a man by the name of Talha ibn Abi Talha al-Adri, and he was a huge man from Quraysh, and he also had the best horse of the Mushrikeen,  he is coming forward and he is challenging the Muslims, and he is the best horseman. When Az-Zubayr goes forward, Safiya comes to the Prophet  and she says, “Ya Rasulullah he is going to kill my son.”  that is not easy, even if you think about the strength and the size. Ali  is sitting in his tent and the sword of Zubayr  comes in front of him and Ali  starts to cry and he starts to weep loudly and Ali  , I heard the prophet  , “When you meet the murderer of Ibn Safiyya, when you see the person who kills Zubayr, tell him he's a person of hellfire.”  Ali had heard this hadith from the prophet , he give the news to the one who murders Ibn Safiyya, Zubayr , that he's a person of hellfire.
