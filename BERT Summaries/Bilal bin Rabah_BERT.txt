--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
But I want us to think about the story of Bilal before Islam, because there's something about the message of the Prophet  that is resonating instantaneously with people that have been subjugated in the name of false gods. And according to Ibn Jawzi and others, this is where the verse in Surah Al-Hujurat, that, “Oh people, we have made you into male and female, nations and tribes, that you may get to know one another and verily, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah  is the one with the most piety.” And of course, Bilal is frequently named in our ummah.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
And his entire life story, or much of his life story, is related to his accepting Islam. He is well known for his struggle, especially as he initially embraced Islam. that's one element that reflects the early downtrodden ones who accepted Islam and struggled alongside the Prophet , to whom this message resonated.

--- Persecution Summary ---
And, , it's mentioned in some of the, in the accounts that Bilal, who loved his mother, used to witness his mother being beaten. Torture him, beat him, insult him, assault him in every way possible to break his spirit. No, Bilal deserves to be the one to chant the adhan, to  la ilaha illallah, standing atop the masjid, because Bilal was the one who was saying la ilaha illallah under that rock and under the most brutal forms of torture.

--- Hijra Summary ---


--- Battle Summary ---
There's a narration about Waraqa ibn Nawfal passing by him. And if you have freed me for yourself, then hold me and do with me what you want.” And Bilal goes out to Ash-Sham in the process of Jihad, just  many of the companions went out in battle against the Romans at that moment.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
Imam Muslim has the virtues of Salman, Bilal, and Suhayb to obviously reflect Salman being the first Persian, Bilal being the first Abyssinian who was enslaved to accept Islam, and Suhayb being the first Roman to accept Islam. And it would infuriate Umayyah because Umayyah felt  he was being generous to Bilal by giving him an easy way out. The first man to call the Adhan in Medina and then in Mecca, will now be the first man to call the Adhan in Al-Quds, making him the first mu'adhin in all three of the holiest places in Islam.

--- Death Summary ---
He may have become a shaheed, a martyr, just  Sumayya. And  that gives some context and I'm jumping a bit because we haven't got to that point of what the death of the Prophet  will do to Bilal. And  Bilal stands up after the death of the Prophet  and he starts to call the Adhan.
