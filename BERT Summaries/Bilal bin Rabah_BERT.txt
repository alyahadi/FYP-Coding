--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
But I want us to think about the story of Bilal before Islam, because there's something about the message of the Prophet  that is resonating instantaneously with people that have been subjugated in the name of false gods. And in the famous narration with Abu Dharr saying those words, and of course some of the narrations suggesting that it was Bilal that he  those words to, it would make sense because it was a reminder that even though Bilal’s father was an Arab, his mother being an Abyssinian who was enslaved, is really what his status was reflective of. And according to Ibn Jawzi and others, this is where the verse in Surah Al-Hujurat, that, “Oh people, we have made you into male and female, nations and tribes, that you may get to know one another and verily, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah  is the one with the most piety.” And , Bilal has the privilege of climbing on top of the Ka’bah and saying, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
that's one element that reflects the early downtrodden ones who accepted Islam and struggled alongside the Prophet , to whom this message resonated. Now Bilal embraces Islam upon hearing of the da'wah of the Prophet  immediately. And all of it comes from obviously the place of certainty and steadfastness that Bilal had when he accepted Islam.

--- Persecution Summary ---
And  when that did not work, when the dehydration did not work and the torture did not work, the next level of cruelty was to take Bilal to the hoodlums of Ta'if. And Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud  that when they were put in the iron chains and tortured most severely, the only one who would never show his pain was Bilal. No, Bilal deserves to be the one to chant the adhan, to  la ilaha illallah, standing atop the masjid, because Bilal was the one who was saying la ilaha illallah under that rock and under the most brutal forms of torture.

Umayyah ibn Khalaf shows up at the Battle of Badr, and we've talked about what happened to Abu Jahl, and we talked about the vengeance, or what happened with Ammar and Khabbab on the Day of Badr, and  many different people seeing their oppressors fall on the Day of Badr. And , Bilal, Ammar, and Suhaib, they come across Abu Sufyan, and they , wallahi“Wallahi, the swords of Allah did not reach the enemies of Allah  they should have..”

 you barely escaped, you're lucky we missed you. And if you have freed me for yourself, then hold me and do with me what you want.” Abu Bakr , “Of course I freed you for Allah, O Bilal.” He says to him, “Go ahead.” And Bilal goes out to Ash-Sham in the process of Jihad, just  many of the companions went out in battle against the Romans at that moment.

--- Virtue(s) Summary ---
Imam Muslim has the virtues of Salman, Bilal, and Suhayb to obviously reflect Salman being the first Persian, Bilal being the first Abyssinian who was enslaved to accept Islam, and Suhayb being the first Roman to accept Islam. And  Bilal is a special man from the companions of the Prophet , whose honor, even if relegated to one area, lives in the ummah today. And that is also important to the context of the adhan of Bilal being the first mu'adhin.

--- Death Summary ---
But Amwas, many of the books  mentioned that this is when Bilal passed away in Ash-Sham due to the plague of Amwas in the year 639, where 25,000 people died, including the likes of Mu'adh ibn Jabal and  many of the great companions of the Prophet . Here is Bilal now, on his deathbed and his wife, as she sees Bilal leaving this world, and Bilal once saw the Prophet  leaving this world and , what a day of grief. And the only reason we don't have more hadith from him is because of the age at which he died, and the distance that he kept away from the city of Medina after the death of the Prophet .
