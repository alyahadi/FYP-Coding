--- Lineage Overview Summary ---
Now a lot of the family history of Banu Hashim we covered when we talked about Ali and Fatima, may Allah be pleased with them, but I want to talk about just a little bit once again about the way that Ja'far  comes into the picture and reminds everyone who his mother is. And this is something that we'll see the deep love that the Prophet  has for Ja'far, which also gives us this idea of silaturrahim, to enjoy good family relations beyond just the siblings, beyond just your own children and your aunts and your uncles. As for Asma’ bint Umais, may Allah be pleased with her, when we talk about the way that the companions used to marry the widows, Asma’ bint Umais, you might have heard her name already a few times as we're going through the stories of these people Asma’ bint Umais  after the death of Ja'far was married to none other than Abu Bakr as-Siddiq .

--- Conversion and Early Islam Summary ---
We know his father Abu Talib and his mother is Fatima bint Asad , who if you remember was the first Hashimi woman to accept Islam. Now, if you remember with Fatima bint Asad, when she accepted Islam, she accepted Islam instantly. And if Ali  embraced Islam that early, and then Fatima bint Asad embraced Islam that early, Ja'far is amongst those who embraced Islam very early on with his cousin, the Prophet .

--- Persecution Summary ---
Now, we don't have much about their life before the migration to Abyssinia, but we do know that they were amongst the family of the Prophet  and they were in that situation, subjected to similar persecution. we're talking about the future batches that would then go to Abyssinia to escape the persecution of Mecca. But they also know that if they are able to get Najashi to send them back, that will be a crippling blow to the Prophet  and to the early Muslims as they are dealing with that persecution.

--- Hijra Summary ---
And  when you talk about the firsts, Ja'far  is not only one of the first converts, he’s part of the first hijrah to Abyssinia even though he's from the second batch to Abyssinia which is modern day Ethiopia. For him and his companions have only one hijrah and you are the people of two hijrahs.”  the Prophet  rules in the favour of Asma’, the wife of Ja'far in that sense and says you are the people of two hijrahs. And these were the people that made the two most noble hijrahs, the hijrah to Abyssinia as well as the hijrah to Medina, all for the sake of Allah .

--- Battle Summary ---
And then, it was only a short time after that he's going to take part in his first battle alongside or under the command of the Prophet , and that is the battle of Mu'tah, which is a difficult battle against the Byzantines who had mobilized to attack the Muslims or they had attacked one of the emissaries, one of the ambassadors of the Prophet . And the Prophet  sends in that battle, it's not that Ja’far had a long time, but Ja’far is distinguished, he sends in that battle the first commander Zayd ibn Haritha, the beloved one of the Prophet . He saw Waraqa, he saw Zaid ibn Amir as we spoke about, and these were people that he saw in Jannah.
